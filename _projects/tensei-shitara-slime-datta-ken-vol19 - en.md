PROLOGUE

I understood that it was a dream.

An unfulfilled dream.

It is not possible for the "King of Justice," who is merely an authority, to aim for the complete revival of the "Star Dragon" Verdunava.

But still, I can't help but hope.

The world without Verdunava is worthless to Michael.

.........

......

...

Mikhail opens his eyes.

He shook his head lightly to shake off the sentimentality.

I can't hide my confusion at being the first person to bare my emotions.

(I thought I was not as naive as Rudra. But I guess not.)

The conclusion would be this.

Trust no one and use them as pawns. If he had done that from the beginning, he could have prevented Obera's betrayal.

He did not do so because he trusted Feldway. As a friend, he believed that the people he trusted would be the people Mikael would trust as well.

But it was a mistake.

When the ultimate ability that he had tied to his hand, the King of Salvation, returned, Michael knew he had failed.

Obera had betrayed us.

He even used his administrative authority to erase the "King of Salvation" to escape from Michael's control.

In order to make up for that loss, we strengthened our control over the angelic holders under our control through Feldway's "Angelic Chief's Rule"...

(Now, the demon tribe is not a problem. (Now, the demon tribe is fine, and the pollywogs may betray us, but our interests are aligned. We'll need to monitor them, but once we've prepared the battlefield, the rest will be taken care of.)

The battlefield is the land of the covenant with the polymaths. Michael had promised Zeranus that he could take any area he wanted and make it his domain.

Yes.

If there was anyone living there, the bugs and demons would take care of them. In other words, Mikael was planning to send Zelanus to the most fierce battleground.

The location was slowly being determined, but there were a few problems.

The first, needless to say, was to deal with Obera, who had betrayed us.

The demon tribe is loyal to Feldway, so there is no need to worry about a drop in morale. If that was the case, he could decide to put it off, considering only the threat level, but he had a feeling that would be a bad move.

Obera's role was to keep an eye on Ivalaje, the dragon of destruction. Now, however, the importance of this role has diminished. It is none of Mikhail's business what happens to the other world, and if anything, he has incorporated the situation of Ivalhajer's manifestation in the base world into his strategy.

In other words, it doesn't matter if Obera abandons his mission. However, if he wanted to cooperate with the enemy forces, such as the Demon Lord Rimuru and the Demon Lord Gee, the story would be different.

In order to nip such worries in the bud, it seemed more certain to take the initiative.

So who should we turn to?

That will be the problem.

The following issues are also relevant to this.

He wondered if he should proceed with the next target as planned. The worry arose that if they were going to take care of Obera, they should rethink their plan.

It's not a trivial matter.

After all, the legions under Obera's command were part of Michael's army.

Mikael was uncomfortable with the loss of power due to his mistake. This was also a new experience for him.

For Michael, who is the core of theosophy, emotions are difficult to understand. And yet, lately, his thoughts had been disturbed like noise in a song.

So it occurred to me that I should try to enjoy the feeling.

(If this is what you call emotion, maybe you should consider yourself lucky. Even if there is only one perfect answer, there are countless ways to get there. (If there is only one perfect answer, there are countless ways to get there, and since the shortest way is not always the right way, we can be allowed to enjoy the process.)

If your emotions are disturbed every time a problem arises, it is healthier to enjoy it.

Impatience narrows our vision, and anger slows our thinking.

There is no point in having regrets, and the constructive thing to do is to avoid making mistakes in the future.

If that is the case, then I have found a solution to dealing with my current problems.

"...... Yes, you're right. I, myself, can defeat the rebels."

The loss of a point should be made up for that day.

Rather than blaming others for your own failures, you should recover from them as soon as possible. Then you will not have to worry about opening any more wounds and you will be able to calmly tackle the next problem.

As soon as he answered that, Mikael's mood lifted.

It was also my first time...

(Emotions are not so bad after all.)

Mikhail felt that he was in the right place.






*






There is no such thing as gravity in the other world.

It is similar to outer space in that there is no concept of heaven and earth.

In the empty space, there are only scattered objects made of condensed magical elements. These objects are as strong as "magical steel" and generate a powerful gravitational pull, so they are used as a base by processing them.

The demon tribe, formerly known as the angel tribe, used such bases to live a life similar to that of the base world, so as not to forget their life in the gravity sphere.

Comparable in size to an asteroid, Obera's base is the frontline base against the Ivalaje. Its strength was unrivaled by any other base, and it was one of the most important facilities for the demon tribe.

Mikhail leapt for the base.


When I made the "spatial transfer" from the Palace of Heavenly Stars to Obera's base, it was already a shell of its former self. However, I could sense the presence of a large army nearby.

That's it, Mikael thought as he turned his gaze.

Obera also seemed to have noticed Mikael's presence and immediately responded by taking an intercepting stance. With one threadbare movement, they formed a full-blown formation and turned their hostility towards Michael.

Because there is no heaven and no earth, the types of formations are different from those on earth. The Manchurian formation was a tactic built on the premise that there were only a few enemies, with the aim of encircling them from above, below, left and right and destroying them.

This is a winning formation against the Phantom Beast Tribe.

The phantasmal race specializes in individual combat skills and rarely gathers together. This is why the tactic of surrounding them in large numbers is very effective.

Obera had always been on the front lines of battle, and his command was superb. And the generals who responded to him were also doing a commendable job.

(Oh, what a waste. I wanted to make effective use of this force anyway...)

Mikhail sighed.

They are fierce warriors who have been able to contain the phantasmal race for a long time. Their usefulness is impeccable, and it would be a shame to lose them here.

However, there is no room left for negotiation.

Mikael's decision to erase the traitor and recover the lost points did not waver in the face of Obera and the others.

That was quicker than I expected.

Obera spoke up.

Mikhail responded with a few words of his own.

"As for making me aware of my blunder, your actions were meaningful. But know that there is no forgiveness for it."

I have no intention of begging your forgiveness. Mikhail?　I don't know if it's the will of authority or what, but I'm not obligated to follow the orders of such a stinking person.

The intentions of both parties were confirmed.

Then, as if on stream, the war began.

Obera was the first to move.

Hundreds of thousands of troops moved at her will, filling the other world with the light of annihilation.

The generals were deployed in a three-dimensional, hemispherical formation by the Manchurian formation. The front of the formation was lined with defenders, and the back of the formation was constantly under attack as the layers were replaced.

This makes it feel as if it is filled with light.

Light converging on Mikael from all sides of the hemisphere.

An army that has been trained to deal with the phantom beast tribe can function without problems even if it is a full army. The energy wave offensive, which thoroughly emphasizes efficiency, can be unleashed continuously even if the troops are replaced.

Naturally, there was no way to avoid it, and Mikael was directly hit by concentrated fire.

Michael, however, was in no hurry.

No matter what the attack, it would not work against the Royal Citadel.

But here's the problem.

"Gosh, is this... pain?"

For some reason, the "Royal Citadel," which was supposed to nullify all attacks, was not activated. As a result, the concentrated fire of Obera's army, which overlapped and became a tremendous energy, burned Michael.

It was unbelievable to Mikael.

His own body was slowly being damaged. Unphased by this, Michael pursued the cause of why it happened.

(...... no energy is reaching the Royal Citadel?　Well, ...... it seems that none of you are loyal to me.)

Mikhail was convinced that this was the reason, but he was correct in his assumption. The charismatic Rudra had a huge base of support among the Imperial subjects. However, Mikhail did not have any subordinates who were loyal to him.

That's because few people in the world knew of Michael's existence, and those rare ones already had a Lord.

They did not trust each other, nor were they in a position to swear allegiance.

The only exception was Feldway, with whom he had a friendly relationship. In addition, he had transferred his ultimate ability, "King of Justice," which was a parallel existence to Mikael's, so they were treated as the same being.

In order to manifest the power of the Royal Citadel, one's own loyalty is meaningless. It is a very natural logic.

(Well, I didn't know anything about my authority, did I?)

Surprisingly, people don't know much about themselves. In the same way, Michael was mistaken about the King of Justice.

He thought he was protecting Feldway with his own "Royal Citadel" when he confronted Rimuru's group on the airship before.

But it was different.

Feldway was Feldway, and he was using his authority.

Unlike then, Mikhail could not use his loyalty to Rudra now. That's why the "Royal Citadel" was ineffective.

As it nullified all attacks, the conditions for using this power had to be severe. Mikhail understood this deeply through his own pain.


Even Obera, the attacker, was surprised by the unexpected turn of events.

He knew about Michael's "royal citadel" because of the information he had received.

He had heard that any attack would be meaningless, so he was puzzled by the damage Mikael was taking. However, he was sure that it was an opportunity, so he issued the order before he could worry about it.

"Keep attacking with all your might!　Keep the linkage smooth and never let Mikael rest!"

The generals knew what they were doing and attacked at full force without needing to be ordered to do so.

Obera thinks.

Michael's pursuit was within the realm of expectation. There was a high possibility that his betrayal would be discovered when he turned off the angelic powers, and he was prepared to take some action at that point.

Because that's what I would definitely do.

As for what to do if that happened, he was going to continue a covert retreat while launching an all-out attack as he was doing now.

The place to run to is the territory of your enemy.

He had planned to guide Mikael and hit the Phantom Beast Tribe.

However, in the current situation, that didn't seem to be necessary.

According to Obera's assessment, Mikhail's energy level was several times greater than his own. He seemed to have a fearsome fighting ability, but his combat experience did not seem to be as good as he thought.

(Can we possibly win this thing?　No, that would be too naive. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask my soldiers to take the bait.)

Obera is a cold-hearted, brilliant commander.

He was willing to sacrifice his weaker subordinates by dividing his army into numbers. The ability to sacrifice the few in order to keep the many alive was also a prerequisite for commanding a large army.

So without hesitation, he could order his men to 'die'.

I had already sorted out who I wanted to keep alive. If Mikhail didn't make a move, we could use the opportunity to "transfer" him.

Now that Michael was here, he would be able to open the Great Gate - the "Gate to the Sky" - from inside the other world.

It was with this foresight that Obera, the strategist, set up this escape.

"Oma, you will lead the first legion out of the battle line. We are headed to our Lord, the Demon Lord Mirim."

This is what Obera commands to his loyal followers. He himself intends to stay here and lead until the end.

The First Legion is the most elite under Obera. Oma is also an excellent second-in-command, and her fighting ability is outstanding. Now that he has gained the body of the Demon Death Tribe, his strength has increased, and he will become an indispensable presence for the Demon Lord Mirim.

This was Obera's last order, and he believed it.

But.

It was not Oma who nodded in agreement.

Oma, who had regained her speech when she became a member of the Demon Death Tribe, asserted fluently.

You've got to be kidding me. The key to the gate can only be handled by you, the Originator. Even so, as a warrior, I would never leave my lord, whom I am supposed to protect, to run away.

Then he showed her a quiet smile.

As if in tune with this, all the generals under Obera's command shouted at the top of their voices.

"Our glory is with you..."

Without Obera, there was no point in surviving. This was their untrue feeling and pride.

If the "King of Justice" had resided in Obera, an absolute "Royal Citadel" would have emerged. An unshakable command and loyal soldiers would have been realized, but unfortunately, that was only a hypothetical.

"You guys ......"

Obera was troubled.

The worst thing that could happen is that we all die here. At the very least, someone had to get to Mirim and tell him about their situation and as much information as they could find.

（Should I stay, or should I let Oma take over?)

At this point, sentiment was irrelevant. What mattered was the decision of which had the higher success rate.

Obera had made his decision and was about to say it when...

"All hands, spread out as fast as you can!"

He sensed something strange and ordered it as quickly as he could.

Obera thought about it, but he kept his attention on Mikael, who was under heavy fire. He would not be foolish enough to show an opening on the battlefield.

So I realized.

Suddenly, Mikhail's energy stopped decreasing.

This meant that he was no longer taking damage, but before he could find out why, he sensed Mikael condensing a huge amount of energy. Therefore, he opened his mouth before he could worry about it.

Following Obera's orders, hundreds of thousands of troops started moving at once. The closer they were to the outer rim, the faster they were, so they tried to spread out in all directions without becoming a traffic jam.

But as if to ridicule his move, Mikael's technique is activated.

"Accelerated Excitation of the Scorching Dragon"

It was a blow that made the power he had gained when he took Verglind completely his own.

A crimson dragon with many heads lays waste to Obera's army, and more than ten thousand people die in that instant.

It was truly a nightmarish scene.

But still, it was better damage than nothing. Because if Obera hadn't noticed, everything would have been over in that instant.

"You...!"

Obera is furious because her cute subordinates have been killed. However, she remains calm despite her anger.

He analyzed the current attack and calculated the force ratio based on its power. On that basis, he concluded that there was an overwhelming difference between the two sides.

It was obvious that this was going to end badly.

In fact, tens of thousands of rays of light that had spread out and started to counterattack had been repelled by the ice wall that Michael had put up.

(It's not just Mr. Verglind, could it be Mr. Versard's power?)

A beautiful, pale, shiny, thin ice enveloped Michael's body. It didn't matter that there was no atmosphere in this other world, Mikael's divine energy was generating supernatural phenomena.

And that power was undoubtedly the "snowflake shield" of the "white ice dragon" Velzard.

An absolute barrier that is said to prevent all attacks. Although it is a defensive technique classified as a physical phenomenon, its nature is said to cut off all wavelengths.

A spirit attack would work, but it would require an amount of energy comparable to that of Velzar to penetrate.

The current Mikael was comparable to, or even better than, Velzard. In other words, it is impossible for Obera alone to shatter the snow crystal shield.

To begin with, there were only a few of Obera's subordinates who could perform a spirit attack like the "Spiritual Child Disintegration. Even if he were to gather the power of all the surviving members of the team and launch the "Spiritual Child Disintegration", it was unlikely that Michael would be able to penetrate it.

Oma, I'm entrusting you with a mission. Run away. And tell Milim-sama..."

I cannot accept this. "I don't accept it, Master Obera, but as your chief of staff, I have the authority to disobey your orders. This will be the perfect moment to do so!"

Oma played again, an infrequent disapproval.

Obera sensed Oma's determination there.

Then there was only one course of action to be taken.

I'll leave this to you. Everyone, do your best!

Die, Obera had ordered.

And yet...

Everyone under Obera's command had a happy expression on their faces.

"Our lives are for your sake!

That declaration will be the signal.

The ruthless violation resumed, and then...

CHAPTER 1

The place where I was "transferred" with everyone was an extremely cold place.

A whole world of silver.

I felt as if I had wandered into Guy's castle.

I tried to use the magic circle for transfer, but the magic didn't work. So, I did a spatial transfer to the limit of what I could see with my "divine eye" surveillance magic, but I was greeted by a cold air that stung my skin.

It's so cold that I feel like I'm freezing to the core.

That's the thing, isn't it?

I can shut down the cold, but I'm still cold, so I definitely feel the effects of Velzade.

The air was filled with a shuddering presence that told us we were in a war zone.

The biggest source of power among them was the battlefield where Guy and Velzard were facing each other. They had created a space of immortality that would not allow anyone else to intervene.

So, I left it there.

I thought I felt something staring at me, but I ignored it.

I felt like I had been hit with a wave of anger that said, "You bastard, you ignored me..." but I shouldn't have thought about it.

I'm an extra person, so I'm not allowed to intervene.


《......》


I felt a hint of dismay from someone, but I couldn't shake the conclusion I had come to.

Jumping into a place that you know is dangerous is not a choice that any intelligent human being should make.

So, I'm going to find out where I should intervene.

The next best sign is... well, Diablo.

The opponent seems to be Zalario, but we'll leave it there as well.

Well, yeah.

We have Diablo, so we should be fine if we let him handle it.

If he can't do anything about it, there's nothing I can do about it.


No, that's not...


Tsk, tsk, you don't get it, do you, Ciel?

I've noticed lately that the Diablo guy, you know, slacks off when I'm watching him.

Maybe he doesn't realize it, but it's like he's not working anymore because he wants to see me in action.


《...... I see, that makes sense.


Oh, it's been a while since I've been able to argue with you, Ciel.

Feeling better, I instructed the others.

We'll leave the outside behind and head for Leon's place. It looks like there are several battlefields, so deal with them accordingly!"

Benimaru, Souei, Ranga and Kumara nodded at my decision.

It was a bit sketchy, but this was an emergency. For the time being, we decided that it would be best if we all went together.

By the way, is there another set of battlefield outside?　There was.

He had sensed a thick magical residue near the ground.

But ...... my instincts told me to ignore that part.

I wonder why?

Without any reason or rationale at all, I decided to go along with it.

Well, now was not the time to worry about it, so I decided to take immediate action.

Everyone seemed to have no objections, and they all started moving toward the castle.






*






Visibility is terrible. Even though I was activating my "universal sensing" at full force, I couldn't even get a sense of distance.

The reason for this is simple: Verizard's blizzard is contaminated with magical elements. That's why it overrides the Natural Effect Disable.

If the space is filled with magical elements, everything will become vague.

So all we could do was to move in the direction of the big swing of the magical element. It was the right thing to do, and we soon arrived at Leon's castle.

The inside of the castle was still better.

It was a relief to have my vision back.

So, I looked for signs of a fight.

'Okay, I've got a visual on Leon. Me and Benimar will head out, you guys head to cover the other battlefield."

Yes!

Yes, sir!

I'm on it.

Without any objection to my order, Ranga, Kumara, and Souei started to move. Without even looking over at them, I had taken Benimaru and activated the "spatial transfer".

In any case, the moment we entered the castle, the signs of battle swelled greatly.

A creepy feeling. I sensed an energy so intense that it surpassed my current full power, and I decided that this was a bad idea.

The scene at the end of the jump looked like a race against time.

I tried to read the situation by accelerating my thoughts several hundred million times faster, but...

Laplace and Tia were protecting one of the women, with Yuki leading the way with the last of her energy.

I've seen that woman before. She was Yuki's secretary - she must have been possessed by the Demon Lord Kazareem. Her name was Kagari, and the last time I saw her, she was being controlled by Lieutenant Kondo, right?

I don't know what happened to him, but he seems to have regained his free will here. No, it's not about that right now, it's about the big fireball that the enemy is about to unleash.

Strengthened by ultimate authority, the great fireball with its pure heat and destructive power shatters even the spirit child.

In other words, even the soul will be destroyed.

And it had already been released long ago.

I'm safe. My "Void God" can eat up the power of destruction, so I am fully protected against the release system.

Of course, Benimaru was also under its influence, so there was no need to worry.

However, Yuki and the others, who were exposed to the large fireball and received its direct hit head-on, were already long damaged.

That was...


No. If you eat him with the Void God, or...


Do it!

Before I could finish listening to all the explanations, I gave the order.

With no time difference, Ciel moved into action.

But, but...

The result was a huge explosion that blew away the castle.

Yuki was swallowed by the light and disappeared.

And Laplace.

The explosion, which was so large that it distorted the space, was greatly suppressed by my power. However, for the two people who are directly hit, .......

"I know I've given you a lot of trouble, but I didn't hate you, Mr. Rimuru.

"Yay, too. I feel safer now that you're here. I'll leave the rest to you!

I thought I heard a voice.

I think it's an auditory hallucination.

Yuki and Laplace had disappeared without a trace.

It's true, I've been annoyed a lot.

But Yuki was a hometown girl who was entrusted by Shizu.

And by the way, I thought Laplace would be able to get to know me in a way that I can't hate him now. ......


《──Because both of those people are stubborn, there's no possibility that they're still alive somewhere.


I don't need your comfort.

It was obvious from the situation that this was a pipe dream.

But, well, those words brought me back to reality.

I thanked Ciel and switched my thoughts.

Yuki and Laplace had been sacrificed, but they had nothing to do with our victory goal. Besides, as far as I knew, they were the most stubborn of the bunch, so there was still a chance that they might be able to make it.

Then it was time to get sentimental.

I've got my work cut out for me.

It would be an insult to them if I did not do this and became consumed with regret.

The time Yuki and Laplace had earned had not been wasted.

This is because Tia risked her life to support the ward that Yuki and Laplace had put up with all her strength, and Cagalli was not seriously injured.

I know this because I quarantined it in my "stomach" and I'm still observing its condition.

It was Ciel who was doing it, which meant that - as a result of Yuki and Laplace's actions - they were able to rescue Tia and Cagalli in time.

After confirming the safety of the two men, I turned my attention to the enemy.

One of them is Feldway.

And the other one is a footman...not a footman.

What can I say, he was a different person from his presence.

It was Leon I was curious about, but he was fighting with someone else I didn't recognize. No, his face looked just like Eltan's, but I could sense that this was also someone else.

She has a very strong presence, just like Eltan, but her essence is different. I could see that she was an ally, though I would have to wait to find out who she was. I'm sure you'll be able to see that she's an ally. She seems to be fighting evenly with Leon, so I'll leave this to you and concentrate on the enemy.

I was expecting you to come after Leon, but you're coming in slower than I expected.

I'll stir things up anyway.

I don't mean to show it, but I feel bad that I couldn't save Yuki and the others. I'm not going to show any such pretense, but I'm disappointed that I couldn't help Yuki and the others. I'm annoyed myself, so I'm not going to show any mercy.

"Who are you?　You are a very ungrateful person for interfering with me."

"Jahil, that's one of the most important people, the Demon Lord Rimuru. You'd do well to remember that."

Mmm-hmm.

So the guy who seems to have taken over Footman is named Jahil. He's the one who unleashed the current attack, so he's definitely a badass.

There are two enemies, and there are two of us.

I'll take care of Feldway, and Jahir will leave Benimal in charge. But from the looks of it...

"Jahir, you say. I'll deal with you."

Whoa, Mr. Benimaru?

He happily stepped forward without my concern.

At this point, there was no point in worrying. I decided to just let it happen and get on with it.

"Huh, I wasn't expecting a fight here, but it'll save me the trouble."

That's what I'm talking about!

I retorted and drew my sword.






*






I'm going to do it, and I'm going to mean it.

Mikhail is difficult to conquer because of the Royal Citadel, but fortunately, he is not here. He really wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to take out Feldway alone.

And I'm a man who doesn't hesitate when he's made a decision.

There is no such thing as a prolonged battle or an interruption. In such a situation, you should decide the game with a killing blow.

Yes, I've prepared for just such an occasion.

The main character of shonen manga has always had that thing, a special move.

"Sword of Emptiness!"

If you ask me what is the most powerful sword technique against an individual, the answer is obvious.

It's a crumbling demon spirit slayer that slices through even spirit children.

So, if you ask me what is the best technique for an individual, the answer will be "Oboro, Currents".

Combining both of these characteristics is Benimaru's special move - "Oboro Black Flame, Currents" - which can also be called his final technique.

This is a sword technique that takes the best of the best techniques and adds the ultimate authority to increase its power. The power of this sword technique has been raised to the point of shattering the spirit child, making it comparable to the Collapsing Demon Spirit Slayer.

There is no doubt that it is the strongest in terms of both power and skill.

And I thought about it, too.

We can't lose to Benimaru, right?

That's why I asked Ciel to help me devise a special move that would be easy to use.

Of course, I only gave my opinion.

They want me to be able to increase the power of my sword techniques by diverting "Emptiness Collapse," which I have trouble understanding even when it's explained to me.

That's how the "Sword Strike of Emptiness" was born.

It does not cut through the spirit child, but eats it. That is the characteristic of this technique.

In order to eat it and throw it into "imaginary space," it has a broken performance that is virtually impossible to defend against.

The only effective way to counter this was to avoid it. It also had the aspect of a complete first strike, which would end immediately even if you caught it with your sword.

One of my aesthetics is that a special move should be a special move. It's no surprise to my friends that I can't get through a second time.

Once you show it to them, they will take countermeasures, so you must not show them your real special moves until the real thing.

It's also possible to use parallel existences like Vergrind to deal with them, but when it comes to battles between high-ranking mental lifeforms, the main focus is on fighting for energy. ...... In other words, the one who exhausts the opponent wins. In the event that you have any kind of questions regarding where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.

It was at this point that I unsparingly revealed my special move, with a strong will to finish off Feldway right there and then.

And yet...

The space made a creaking sound and my sword was caught by it.


What the...?


I felt a hint of surprise from Ciel.

I suppose that's true. I'm surprised, too.


I never thought that the Lord's fear of that jinx would be proven. ......


Hmm?

What do you mean, jinxed?


Yes. It's a shonen manga promise that if you bring a special move to the first move, it will be prevented. ......


Buh-oh!

You, you blew it in this serious scene!

No, I told you, didn't I?

I'm sure that's what he said.

But you don't think ......?

.............


《............》


Phew.

Let's forget it.

It happens.

He was caught by the sword as if it were a joke, and it seemed to upset him a bit.

I change my mind and focus on Feldway.

Ciel had preceded me and had started to investigate the cause of why it was prevented. It would be useless to attack until we get the results, but we need to dare to pretend that we don't care.

I decided to try to have a conversation with Feldway while also bluffing.

"Wow, you're really good at preventing that."

Pretending that my inner turmoil was not there, I slashed at him and spoke to him. I thought he would ignore me, but surprisingly, he responded.

"The Black King misses you, so it's not as if you're a threat to him.

He's got an irritating way of saying things.

I don't think anything of it being compared to Diablo, but I can't believe they didn't give it a shot in the teeth when they even came up with a new special move. ......


No, it's unnatural. I can't imagine that there's anyone who doesn't feel threatened by it. The only one I can think of is Mikael, who is protected by the Royal Citadel...


You say that, but in reality, it didn't work at all, did it?

At this rate, I don't think even the Doomsday Collapse Annihilation Wave that I learned from watching Carrera use it in the labyrinth will work.

It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.

So, you would think that slashing the body would be enough, but this is not so easy.

Because Feldway's guy is usually strong.

When we crossed swords like this, I felt that Feldway's ability was also quite good. Even if you only look at his pure swordsmanship, he's as good as or better than me. I'm not sure, but I'd say he's on par with Benimar.

Now that I was also a dragon, my physical abilities had greatly increased. It was not a metaphor, but I could move several times more than before. In addition to that, I thought that my sword skills had also improved, but Feldway was unable to understand.

In my case, I'm able to deal with it because I cheat in many ways, and if it comes to it, I can ask Ciel to take over for me, but if it's a fair and serious game, I feel like I don't stand a chance.

Then he should shift to magic attacks, which he could not catch with his sword, but large-scale magic would cause enormous damage to Leon's kingdom.

So, the only option is magic against individuals.

The "apocalyptic collapse and annihilation wave" that I just mentioned has a destructive power that could affect this planet, so it is impossible to use it anyway.

However, I used it as an example because it is one of the strongest in terms of power, but I can't think of any other magic against people that surpasses it. I can't think of many magic against people that can surpass it.

A simple personal nuclear bombardment method: heat convergence cannon is not far from the power of "spirit decay". ......

I'm not sure what to do, but I'm not sure what to do. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.

Fortunately, Feldway is taking a wait-and-see approach.

If they started to fight back, I wouldn't be able to afford it. For now, though, it seemed the best course of action was to try to find a way out of the situation while talking.

I mouthed the words, trying not to let him know how annoyed I was.

"I'm just a harmless slime. I guess it's no wonder I don't seem like a threat."

"Well, you're talking nonsense. That's the kind of thing that makes you feel like he's your squire."

I'm not happy?"

"I see. You are a distraction to me, so I have no reason to please you. If you feel bad about it, it's a superposition."

I thought you'd ignore me, but surprisingly, the conversation will continue.

So it's even more disappointing.

If it's someone you can't even communicate with, you can take them down without a second thought. ......

Well, I'm in the middle of trying to figure out a strategy, so I don't have enough time to talk about it from the top.

But I'm curious.

Why doesn't Feldway fight back?

It's a good thing for me, but if I don't do something about it, I'm going into a thousand suns.

I'm using "Emptiness Decay", but it's an absorption system, not a release, so I'm not that fatigued. However, the same is true for Feldway, who has not been damaged.

He seemed to be defending himself with some kind of authority, but since he was all about defense, the fatigue seemed minor.

One of the strategies was to use a sword technique that Feldway couldn't even catch.

In fact, I have one more real secret trick up my sleeve.

It's a technique that I improved and evolved from Benimaru and Carrera's "Currents", and it's a special move that I can't handle without Ciel's full backing.

It's a technique that's beyond my current capabilities, so I'm hesitant to use it because I feel like I'm cheating a lot.

But now I can't say that, and I'm thinking of using it when the opportunity arises... but I just can't picture it succeeding.

It's kind of creepy.

It seems that Ciel agrees with me, and I think we should prioritize finding out Feldway's secret for now.

That's why I'm in a thousand suns, but if you think about it the other way around, it was a good situation to calmly check the status of the war.

I'm also concerned about the safety of the others.

I didn't let my guard down on Feldway, but I also turned my attention to my friends.






*






It's Benimaru I'm worried about.

The other party was apparently a higher-ranked one, so I didn't look at him, but tried to use "universal sensing" to see what was going on.

Yeah?

Jahir was wielding a ghastly blood-colored spear.

I don't know when or where he took it out, but I could feel the tremendous power from that spear.


"That spear seems to be called the Blood Spear of the Divine Ancestor. "This spear was given to me by the divine Ancestor, I will stab you with it!" He said boldly.


Nah, I see. .......

Ciel-san, unlike me, seemed to have a grasp of the war situation on Benimaru's side.

It's true that I'm in a tricky situation right now, but I'm not in a tight spot. At worst, I have Verdra, so even if I die, I can be resurrected. So, although it may sound like I don't have enough of a sense of urgency, I knew that I shouldn't be in a hurry until I found a way to attack.

So, I continued my observation.

I don't know what kind of being Jahil was, but he looked comfortable enough to have taken over the footman. In other words, his movements were light and his spear wielding was well done.

He could see it because he had multiplied his perception speed by several hundred million times, but no matter how you looked at it, it was that of an expert. It was hard to believe that it was someone else's body, and it was obvious just how troublesome Jahir was.

Moreover.

Jahir's existence value is more than three times that of Benimaru, and incredibly, that spear - the Blood Spear of the Divine Ancestors - is estimated to have an existence value of more than 10 million.

It's foul play, a weapon like that.

This is outside the labyrinth of Ramiris, so I don't know the exact numbers, but overall, the difference in strength is more than four times.

It was a situation where the game was barely viable because Benimaru was superior in skill.

Or rather, if Benimaru hadn't had the "shimmer", he would have been defeated long ago.

That's why that bastard Jahir is such a nasty piece of work.

If it were true, I'd like to join the helpers right now.

But I don't have that kind of time, so I have to ask Benimaru to do his best.

So, what's the status of the other group?

This one is a complete sennichi-te.

The mysterious woman who is playing with Leon, who looks just like El-tan so people think she is related to him, is as good as the Awakened Demon King.

No, maybe more than that?

Apparently, he possessed the ultimate ability, and he did his best to keep up with Leon without taking a step back.


The fighting styles of both of them are very similar. I'm guessing that they have a master-disciple relationship.


Mmm-hmm.

I hadn't noticed because they were using different types of weapons, but now that you mention it, they might look alike. Maybe that woman is Leon's mentor.

And that even the lineage of the ultimate ability is similar.

We can read each other's moves, so that's why we're in a thousand suns.

I don't think this is going to be an easy decision anymore. I couldn't expect any help, but I should have thought it was better that they didn't need my support.

"It's you, isn't it, Rimuru?　If you can afford to observe me, I'd like you to help me out a bit, okay?"

Whoa, you're quite the intuitive one.

I was caught watching the game with a jittery look on my face.

I can't afford it either, but I'm sure I've been watching others fight, so it feels hard to say no.

So here, I'll answer as honestly as I can.

"I'm sorry. I didn't have anything to do either, so I just looked around.

What?　What kind of nerves do you have to have to do something like that when you can't afford it?　I've heard from Elle that you don't have any common sense, but I think you'd better get over yourself.

You are too right.

I was caught off guard because I didn't think I'd be found out, but it certainly wasn't common sense to look away in the middle of a battle.

We will take your comments back to our office and consider them seriously.

"Well, it sounds like you're not interested in improving, but okay. So, do you think you can win?"

You're a sharp guy, you know that?

I was going to keep it light and deceptive, but you've seen through me.

Well, I'd better start taking this seriously, or Feldway will be staring at me in a very bad way.

I answered the question, bracing myself for a possible counterattack.

Not at the moment. There's no room for error."

Hearing this, Feldway snickered.

Then, unexpectedly, he joined in the conversation.

"I'm afraid you're not just looking over your shoulder while I'm fighting, you're having a conversation with me. And yet, you say you have no chance to take advantage of me?　That's ridiculous. I don't know what you're talking about."

"Shut up!　It's because I showed you my trump card and you easily blocked it!　If you'd have just let me get hit with that, I wouldn't have had to go through all the trouble!

"Don't make me laugh. If you hadn't interfered with me, our plans would have been realized much earlier. You can imagine how many of our plans have been foiled because of the Black King under your command in the first place!

Apparently, I was too agitated and made him angry.

I had nothing to do with that Diablo thing.

It's the owner's responsibility.

No, we haven't known each other that long.

I'm a person who doesn't take on unnecessary responsibility. I firmly insisted that I was not at fault here.

He's really cocky."

"Hmm, I agree. You're amazing. I have a little bit of respect for you, being able to be so relaxed in this situation!"

That's not very complimentary, is it?

I mean, you should be focusing on Leon then!

What a surprise.

I would never say that, though, because it would be more than a bushwhacker.

What about you, by the way?

"Oh, me?　I'm Elle's mom. You can call me Sylvia!"

It was an amazing self-introduction.

I'm not sure what to make of it, but I think it's a good idea.

I glanced around and observed that they were playing a close game that it was a wonder they had time to talk.

Both Leon and Sylvia were dodging each other's swords by the skin of their teeth and fighting back, as if they were practicing for a fight.

He seems to have a lot of guts, because he can talk lightly under such circumstances.

"So, how's it going with Leon?　You're the master, aren't you?"

"Oh, you'll understand?　I'm not denying that he's a master, but I don't think he can handle it. If I'm being honest, I didn't expect Leon to be this strong. ......

His response sounded like he was joking, but he probably meant it.

They've been walking a tightrope in the battle since before we arrived, so it's no wonder they're losing focus. The current state of equilibrium will collapse if any part of it is missing, so it's certainly not the time to be complacent.

Then ...... I pondered what to do about Leon.

I have a plan against Leon, but I'm not sure if I should go through with it. I'd like to aim for a more effective timing anyway, but now doesn't seem to be the right time.

The situation was grim, but we were still in a state of equilibrium. I felt that if I pushed too hard, I might end up putting myself in danger.

We'll continue to wait and see about Leon.

When I make such decisions, I get complaints from Benimaru.

"Rimuru-sama, I understand that you can afford it, but it's really hard for me!

Unusually, Benimaru is whining about it - and that's not surprising.

A difference of more than four times is tough to beat.

Is it bad?

It's really bad.

I know, right?

It was fortunate that Jahil's specialty seemed to be flame-based, which gave him an advantage over Benimaru in terms of compatibility.

Otherwise, they would have been defeated long ago, so the current situation was even miraculous.

Well, what can we do about it? .......

When this equilibrium is broken, the outcome of the war will be decided, but even I don't have enough power. I have a few trump cards hidden, but it's hard to know when to cut them.

As for the opponents, aside from Leon, Feldway and Jahir looked comfortable.

We are overwhelmingly at a disadvantage.

So maybe I should kill the enemy elsewhere and wait for someone to come running to me, or use one of my secret methods, summoning a demon to summon Testarossa.

However, I was afraid that if I did that, the other party would be able to do the same, and it would turn into a quagmire.

I think it's better to wait and see what happens.

"Benimaru, just hang in there a little longer!"

"Wait, we can't really buy that much time!"

It's been a long time since I've heard such a pathetic response from Benimar.

Thinking about this, I started to discuss with Ciel once again if there was any way to break out of this situation.






◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇






Ranga, Kumara, and Souei, who were separated from Rimuru, were each heading to support a different opponent. They didn't consult with each other in particular, but naturally decided where to go based on the general strength of the enemy.

The person Ranga was headed for was Vega.

It was giving off the biggest sign of life and was outpacing even Ranga.

And as expected, that was the most fierce battleground.

(Mmm, it looks like he's stronger than me, but if we bide our time, Souei-dono and the others should be able to finish off the enemy and rush to our aid. ......)

Ranga trusts his friends.

That's why I'm convinced, without question, that I can take on strong opponents without fear.

I'll help you!

Ranga shouted and jumped at Vega.

Mater was delighted by this.

Sir Mater the White Knight, the leader of the White Knights under Leon, was desperately working on recovery, but there was a limit to how much time he could buy with his current strength alone.

The five demons under Rain and Misery's command - the "demon lords" named Misora, Squall, Ulrich, Alban, and Georg - are all as powerful as the old demon lords. However, the value of Vega's existence exceeded 10 million, and the difference in ability was too great.

As Rain's second-in-command, Misora, the duke-ranked commander, was very talented. She was always taking care of Rain, who tended to slack off, so she had a wide perspective and was able to follow up on everything.

But even so, there was no such thing as command when some of them were incapacitated by Vega's blow.

In spite of this, the battle line did not collapse, thanks to Misora's hard work. And it was Mater's recovery magic that was desperately supporting her.

These proud demons, who were normally individualistic, had somehow managed to maintain the front line by sparing no effort to cooperate with all five of them, and even used some minor illusionary magic trickery. However, when Ulrich and Alban fell at the same time, the burden on the remaining members increased. Mater's recovery could not keep up, and annihilation was imminent.

It was at this critical moment that Ranga intervened.

"What the hell, you dog!　Don't you dare interfere with me!"

Vega was ecstatic.

He has gained great power and is now under the illusion that he is invincible.

For that reason, he decided that the addition of one more demon to the area would not be much of a threat.

But that's a mistake.

Ranga's value is less than half of Vega's, but his combat experience cannot be underestimated. He is always lurking in Rimuru's shadow, and has witnessed many battles.

That's why Ranga was able to take a flexible stance according to the enemy.

The strategic victory this time was to get through this without any casualties. If he understood that, he would be able to see his own role.

"Use me as a shield and regain your position. Reinforcements will come. My Lord will not be defeated!"

Wagging her tail, Ranga assured her.

With that, Misora and the others knew that Rimuru had arrived.

Misora accurately read Ranga's intentions and figured out the best way to move.

"I'll take your word for it. Maetel-dono, please concentrate on Ranga-dono."

And so the tactics were quickly rearranged, and the battle turned to Langa as the key element.

From this point on, the peak of Vega's career came to an end.

The reason was that Ranga, whom I had dismissed as a lowly competitor, had performed better than I had expected.

Without thinking, Vega attempted to eliminate Ranga. He fully exercised his ultimate ability, the Evil Dragon King, and tried to subdue him with pure power...


The ultimate ability, "Evil Dragon King," was a power acquired in reference to Vega's background.

Vega has inherited the blood of the "Magical Inquisitor," one of Rosso's research results. He was a monster with the characteristics of both demon and human, and could recover from any injury as long as he was fed.

It was a secret that Yuki had modified it to become a pseudo-artificial viscous body.

Vega's body is a collection of minuscule magical bacteria. Therefore, he can regenerate freely, and as long as some part of his body remains, he can be revived without any problems.

It was adept at mimicking the structure of living things, and depending on the odds, it could even acquire the abilities of its predators.

It was because of this that Vega was able to acquire the ultimate ability, the Evil Dragon King.

The essence of this power is that it absorbs the power of the target it feeds on, just like the essence of Vega.

It is a power that is very similar to the "King of Voraciousness" that Rimuru possessed, and is a collection of terrifying abilities such as "super-fast thinking, parallel thinking, analytical appraisal, organic domination, duplicate mass production, ability absorption, and multiple boundaries.

Its performance is very high.

If the eaten person has a physical body, he or she will read information through "organic domination" and gain race abilities.

Even if it was a mental life form, it was still able to take energy through "ability absorption" and even make its own abilities.

In addition to that, as long as there is an organic body to be used as a material, it is possible to mass produce and control a "duplicate" that resembles itself.

If you can use it, you can be as strong as you want to be. That's the whole point of the ultimate ability, "Evil Dragon King".

If you can use it, go to .......

Unfortunately, Vega hadn't had that much experience since he was born.

He had grown at an alarming rate, and his power had only increased, but he had not yet mastered his powers.

All Vega could do was strengthen her body with Organic Domination, understand her enemy's weaknesses with Analytical Appraisal, and weaken her enemy with Ability Absorption.

He had been unconsciously using "Super Speed Thinking", so he was able to make good decisions, but unfortunately, he was not able to reach "Parallel Thinking", and despite the overwhelming advantage, he was unable to achieve victory.

However, Vega himself was enjoying his strength so much that he didn't even realize that he had missed his greatest opportunity. ......


And then Vega's fist, with its vicious power, pierced Ranga.

"Mmm?"

Vega wondered at the lack of response.

I was sure I had penetrated it, but I didn't feel anything.

Not only did it take away energy, but it couldn't even do an "analytical appraisal" of the enemy.

The reason for this is that Ranga is using his authority to the fullest.

Ranga's power - his ultimate ability, the "Star Wind King" - had the effect of transforming his body into a "magical wind".

Ranga has turned into a terrifying "demon wind" that contaminates everything it touches, and physical attacks won't work... in fact, the moment you touch him, the "wind that brings death" will damage you.

Now, Ranga is magic itself.

The logic is the same as that of Carrion's Beast King's Flash Howl, which maintains its form and mass, but is transformed into a willful particle with the destructive energy of a spirit life form.

Even a mere physical hit can be an attack with great destructive power. I don't need to tell you how terrifying this technique is.

In the case of Ranga, unlike Carrion, it is not a special move but a state change. Naturally, the rate of energy consumption would be higher, but there would be no restrictions placed on him just because he was in the "magic wind" state.

This is the strength of those who can fully handle their authority.

Although Vega was superior in terms of existence value, Ranga was the overwhelming winner in terms of ability.

"Hahaha, that fist doesn't seem to be working on me, does it?"

In fact, Ranga was surprised.

He had assumed that Vega was stronger and had been warned.

Since Rimuru was always so cautious, Ranga had learned to imitate him. That's why he was not letting his guard down at all against Vega, who had more than twice as much energy as he did.

So much so that I suspected it was a trap of some kind.

Damn you!　You're a dog, you're a dog, you're a dog, you're a dog.

And it was only when he was hit by an enraged Vega that he realized that the other party was an idiot.

If you hit Ranga, who has turned into a demon wind, without thinking, the result will be no different than hurting yourself. Vega took the damage on his own, leaving Ranga dumbfounded.

In this case, the correct answer is to wrap your fist in the aura strengthened by the power and then hit it. The same goes for attacking with a weapon; the only way to deal with the power is to use it.

If it was a mental life form, it could be as effective as the ultimate authority by increasing its energy, but Vega had not taken any such consideration.

If he had been able to use his ultimate ability, the Evil Dragon King, he would not have been in such a disgraceful state.

"You fool! I thought he was trying to trick me, but it looks like he was serious. If that's the case, then let me make a move at once."

As soon as Ranga declares this, he begins to seriously sprint. It becomes a jet-black wind that tosses Vega around, leaving the sound behind and filling the space with afterimages from the earth to the sky.

Then it became a howling that reverberated into the interior of the space.

Ranga amplified his own speed and destructive power with the "Sound and Wind Control" of the "King of the Star Winds", created a force field with the "Space Control" while running, and then created a "Black Lightning Storm" within the force field with the "Weather Control" for the final blow. The "thunder of the apocalypse" roared out.

The name of the technique is "Doomsday Demon Wolf Dance".

It was the most powerful personal attack technique that Ranga had devised.

Incidentally, if you roar like a howler, you can also shoot it out as a directional beam. Originally, that was the easier and more correct way to use the beam, but if you want to do more damage, you should use a beam that is confined to a certain space, like this one. By confining the target, we can eliminate the waste of energy and expect a greater effect.

Vega took a direct hit from this, but to his surprise, he survived.

Even though he was not able to use the Evil Dragon King properly, he was unconsciously affected by the power of the authority to his body.

Moreover, the Vega's characteristics can be summed up in its stubbornness.

Although he was not unharmed, he was able to regenerate his own body in time before he disappeared by using "organic domination" and "mass reproduction".

It's not as if the amount of magical elements is undeserved.

Vega took a deep breath and barked with all his might.

"Fuck, fuck, fuck. ────!"

Then, he glared at Ranga with guile.

Vega took a deep breath to calm his mind, and then told him to spit it out.

"Tsk!　It's been a long series of battles, and it looks like I'm tired too. I'll call it a draw for today, so next time we meet, be prepared!　See ya."

Vega is a coward, but he is also an excellent sense of danger. Realizing that the situation had become unfavorable, she immediately made the decision to flee.

As a Ranga, I have no objection.

As you can see from the fact that he withstood his own strongest move, Vega is superior to him in terms of existence value. He knew that he would not be able to defeat Vega if he could not finish him with his current blow. If that is the case, he thought, there is no need to force it.

The tactical goal was to buy time, and if they were able to force Vega to retreat, they were well on their way. Therefore, Ranga's decision to forgo an engagement with Vega was a very good one.

Thus, the battle with Vega, the most fierce battleground, came to an end.


Now, they were all happy to see Ranga's support, but...

Misora thought.

(This werewolf, Ranga, was the pet of the Demon Lord Rimuru, right? So why is it so strong?)

Its strength was unreasonable.

Misora had a rough idea of the size of Vega and Ranga's energy. If you are a strong man, you cannot survive without being able to measure the strength of your enemies.

In Misora's estimation, Ranga was at a very high level, but still, Vega seemed to be a more troublesome opponent.

And yet, the result was an overwhelming victory for Ranga.

He had been thinking of using Ranga as a shield now to reorganize his tactics, but he felt like he had been let down.

"Misora, there are great beings in this world. When you see Rimuru-sama, you'll understand how I feel right now.

This reminded Misora of her boss's words.

"I see. ...... Seeing the pet makes the owner understand. I didn't doubt your words, but now I truly understand them.

The four remaining "demon lords" nodded in agreement as Misora muttered to herself.

And others, such as Sir Mater the White Knight, who was about to run out of magic power, were stunned to find that they had no part to play.

I think of it as an escape from reality.

(I love dogs and have always wanted one. They're so dependable, I'll have to rush off to the pet store to buy one after this battle is over!)

It was a complete abandonment of thought.

By the way, pet stores in this world do not sell pet dogs. They sell animals and demons that have been trained by trainers and can really fight for a high price.

Later, Mater would "name" the forest werewolf he had purchased Ranga II, but that's another story.






◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇






The leader of the Red Knight Order, Sir Fran, and the leader of the Yellow Knight Order, Sir Kizona, were struggling against Orlia.

The term "struggling" is a naive estimate.

Because if Orlia had really intended to kill them, the victory or defeat would have been decided at that moment.

"Kuh, too strong. ......"

Fran murmurs, biting her lip.

Agreeing with her was Kizona, who was exposed to Orlia's attack.

"You're being played. What's next, a club?　It was a dagger earlier, but they're making the weapons weaker and weaker, testing their performance on us."

Kizona's point is correct.

At first, Orlia was holding a star cudgel.

With that blow, Kizona's full body armor was shattered. She was prepared to be killed by the next blow, but Orlia's next action was to change her weapon.

I could only think that I was being licked, but I also thought I was lucky.

"I hate it when people make fun of me this much, but I guess it can't be helped since the gap in ability is that wide. ......

"Let's think positive. If we keep stalling, Master Leon will surely come to our rescue!"

Fran and Kizona, with an unlikely hope in their hearts, do not give up and face Orlia. Both of them understand that such hope is an illusion.

He thought that their master, the Demon King Leon, would be in a more troublesome situation.

Otherwise, Leon would not have abandoned his men.

So, all they could do was try to stay alive until help arrived.

But that had long since run its course.

The difference in strength was too great. Not even ten minutes had passed since the start of the battle, and the two were already wounded.

And Orlia, too, was satisfied that she had finished testing her authority to some extent.

"Yes. Can we go now?"

As soon as Orlia said this, she transformed her weapon into a trident. It was the serious equipment of a woman who had once been named "Orca".

Fran and Kizona also understood that Orlia's presence had changed.

(I've tried my best to get to this point or ......, but I'm sorry I couldn't fulfill my mission...)

Fran was so desperate.

Kizona was more immediate.

(I wanted to have cake at the end: ......)

I'm waiting for the last time, thinking about such things as

However, it will not come.

Instead, they came for...

You seem to be in trouble. I thought it would be tactless of me to intervene, but I'll leave the matter to you.

Kumara, who had transformed into a beautiful woman, stood in front of Orlia as if to protect Fran and Kizona.


Thus, the battle between Kumara and Orlia began, but this time it was again one-sided.

What was different from before was that Orlia was completely pushed.

"How could you be so stupid?"

A cry of astonishment spilled out of Orlia's mouth.

Orlia's ultimate grant, the "King of Creation," is the power to create mythic-grade weapons of any performance. The full-body armor he wears is also, of course, mythic grade.

And yet, the nine-tailed piercing strike that Kumara unleashed by manipulating his tail was damaging Orlia, ignoring the mythical-class armor. It didn't shatter the armor, but the impact penetrated and reduced Orlia's strength.

"It's weak. We don't need to send out the Eight Particulars in this case.

Kumara had wondered if he should send out a tail beast to gauge the enemy's strength, but after one battle, he had decided that it was not necessary.

Orlia is a fearsome opponent who is a top-notch warrior and even controls advanced magic. However, her movements do not deviate from the realm of human beings and do not betray any of Kumara's expectations.

For Kumara, who had gained experience against strong opponents such as Carrion and Frey, he was too much of a lackluster opponent.

The only thing to keep in mind was Orlia's armament, but that, too, could not be a threat to Kumara.

Because the Kumara had evolved even further.

From the Nine Tails of Heavenly Star to the Divine Fox.

Kumara's power was greatly increased by her divine nature.

Of course, Orlia has a divine nature, as she has a fierce angel in her. In addition, if you compare only the value of existence, there was not that much difference between them.

Kumara had grown a little, but was still just under 2 million, while Orlia was a little over 2 million. If the comparison was based on numbers alone, Orlia had the advantage.

And yet...

Orlia, with her only experience as a human, had too limited a range of uses for her power.

In the past, Orlia, Orca and Aria were the most senior members of the mixed army under Yuki's direct command. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.

The "souls" of these two people mixed together and awakened as the Demon Death Tribe, and even gained the power of a cutthroat angel. In addition to that, the ultimate grant from Michael, the right to act on his behalf, transformed him into the "King of Creation", so he was sure that there was no enemy on earth.

As a result of experiments with Fran and Kizona to confirm this, Orlia was convinced that her power was the strongest.

The weapons created by the power are no match for any mythical class in existence. As proof of this, Fran and Kizona's attacks had no effect on Orlia. They couldn't even touch her body, and she was bounced in front of the mythical class armor.

And the weapon would shatter the enemy's weapon with just a light swing.

Orlia had overestimated her own power.

That's why we don't acknowledge the reality, and we make bad decisions.

"I hope you don't lick me!　Let's get serious from here!"

As if the experiment was over, Orlia swung her trident with all the skill she had.

The magic that Aria was good at was transformed into a purple light and wrapped around her, and even Kumara would have been mortally wounded if she had been hit by the spear delivered by Orca's brilliant skill.

But.

Nine tails clothed with divine energy move freely to block the trident.

At this point, the difference in ability was obvious to everyone.

Just as it is natural for people to differ in strength even when they have the same physical abilities, there is a gap between those who have studied martial arts and those who are amateurs in fighting - or even more than that.


Even Fran and Kizona, who were just watching the battle between the two men, could clearly understand the difference.

"Awesome. ......"

"Hey, hey, is he one of His Majesty the Demon Lord Rimuru's men?"

I don't know, but I'm pretty sure he's on our side.

"What can I say? I think we've come to an understanding that we should never antagonize them. Because, you know, even people that we don't know are so strong. ......"

"Shut up. You don't have to tell me, I agree with you."

I was admiring Kumara's bravery while conversing with him.

Kumara herself, a bewitching beauty, stood gracefully without moving an inch. Once I realized this fact, I felt as if I was being shown that I was not at the stage of arguing about who was better.

Now, are you ready?"

Kumara asks, her smile deepening.

I don't approve. No, I won't admit it. I, we have the most powerful power in the world. This power is only for the service of the great Michael!"

"Hmm, is that so? But it won't work for me.

Kumara ruthlessly tells Orlia, who is very upset.

It was an obvious fact, but it was enough of an insult to make Orlia angry.

"I hope you're not kidding!　I am Orlia. I'm Orlia, and I'm the one who will avenge you, Mikael-sama!"

Orlia did her best to set Kumara up with her own pride.

But that was a reckless thing to do.

A suicide attack without a plan is nothing but a pointless attack for Kumara.

Orlia's spear was flicked by Kumara's tail, and her limbs were also entangled in the four tails.

There was a dull thud of shattered joints, and the cruel end came for Orlia. "My name is Kumara. I am Kumara, the Phantom King. I'll take this as a souvenir of my death."

Kumara came forward belatedly as he slammed a barrage of tails into the immobilized Orlia.

Arios had mastered the use of the ultimate grant, "King of Punishment," and was overwhelmed against the leader of the Blue Knights, Sir Oxian, and Misery's second-in-command, Khan.

The one-handed sword that Arios holds is also a mythical grade that he borrowed from Orlia. When he was a human, he had gained unimaginably powerful power, and he had been growing in stature.

That was why Arios had put off killing them. The two lower-ranked men were just the right playmates to test his strength.

Both Orlia and Arios know that it is not a commendable act for the strong to bully the weak. Unlike Vega, the two of them have common sense and would not normally get personal in the middle of a mission.

This time, however, things were different.

He thought that if he didn't test his power, which was very different from what he had been used to, it would hinder him in future battles.

As a first-class warrior, it was necessary for me to know what I could do and to what extent I could push myself. That is why he took this opportunity to allow himself a certain amount of play.

Oxyan and Khan knew exactly what Arios intended to do. It was humiliating for the two proud men, but this time it was convenient.

The reason was that the victory condition was to buy time, and it was difficult for the two of them to achieve that with their abilities.

So even though he understood that he was being played with, he had no choice but to face Arios with desperation.

Aside from the intelligent Oxian, the old great demon Khan's insides were boiling like magma.

（I'll kill him. I'll never forgive this guy!)

Khan was the first of Misery's subordinates, and was usually a calm and collected person.

However, her patience was no match for Missoula. I was always in awe of my colleagues, wondering how they could endure under that Rain-sama.

So now that he had been humiliated so much, Khan's exasperation had reached its peak.

However, there was a brutal wall between him and Arios.

In terms of strength, there is no difference. In fact, Oxyan and Khan are probably better than him.

Even so, the reason why it is so one-sided is because there is a gap of several times in the value of existence. In addition, Arios has the dreaded "King of Punishment".

If it was only a mythical weapon, it could not compete with the ultimate authority.

It had been a short but painful time, but it would soon come to an end.

I could tell by the hint that Arios' face had changed.

"Heh, that's enough. You guys were pretty strong, weren't you?　Well, I've had a lot of fun with you, so I'm going to kill you easily without causing you any more pain."

Having tested his strength enough, Arios decided it was time to call it a day. He told Kahn and the others.

There was nothing he could do about it, so Oxian made up his mind.

(We have to leave the rest to Master Leon. Let's apologize in the afterlife for not being able to fulfill our mission until the end!)

Oxyan apologized inwardly.

Khan also had anger etched in his "soul".

（I may die here, but I will not forget my grudge. Arios, I remember that name. I'll come back and kill you!)

For demons, death is simply a change of state.

If the core of the heart was not damaged, it would take several years to revive. Depending on the amount of damage, it could take hundreds of years or more, but even so, it was always possible to come back to life.

Therefore, Khan vows to take revenge.

Incidentally, it was necessary to interfere with the spirit child in order to damage it to the heart core.

If you don't destroy the spirit child, you can't reach the "information child" as represented by the "spirit child collapse.

Now that Arios has the "King of Punishment", he can shatter the heart core if he knows it to be so.

Khan, however, was not so worried.

Arios's swordsmanship, physical skills, and authority were all top-notch, but his spirit had not deviated from that of a man.

He didn't seem to have much experience in dealing with non-humans, and he didn't seem to be familiar with how to deal with demons.

That was why Khan thought he could get away with this by pretending to be dead.

Arios' sword was held up to Oxian, and the gun in his hand was pointed at Khan.

Khan's body was already at its limit. As long as Arios was serious, it would be impossible to continue fighting any longer. Although he felt bad for Oxyan, Khan's strength was that he could calmly divide the situation.

（That's it. A successful retreat...)

While Khan was thinking this, Alios took one look at him with a broad smile and put his finger on the trigger.

"Haha!　You first..."

Khan thought that he should just smile for now, but then he had to peel his eyes away.

Someone jumped out from the shadows behind Arios, at his feet, and swung his sword.

The crisis situation was over at this point.






*






Khan recognized the man.

I recall that he was a subordinate of the demon king Rimuru, and that he called himself Souei.

At about the same time, Oxyan noticed it as well.

"Lord Souei, your reinforcements arrived in time!"

When Oxyan shouted with joy, Souei replied bitterly.

I was going to kill it with one blow, but I guess I was a little naive. It's still alive, so don't let your guard down."

Although Souei is a gentleman in front of Rimuru, he is basically a confident and self-centered person. He doesn't take kindly to the heads of state of other countries, but he doesn't take kindly to executives.

And now, in an emergency, he had taken control of the situation as a matter of course, and had put Oxian and Khan under his command.

On the other hand, Arios was taken by surprise, but as Souei said, he was still alive. He was vomiting blood, but somehow managed to regain his position.

Arios was aware just before he struck the killing blow from the blind spot that carried Souei's power of "one blow, one kill" - the blow of dark death - and narrowly avoided the attack that would have pierced his heart.

You're a real piece of work, aren't you?

"Your reaction time is also impressive. But I won't miss the next one."

Both sides rush into battle as soon as that is all they have to say.

Arios is arrogant, but cautious.

Before he was reincarnated as "Yoten", he was a powerful man from another world.

He had also been involved in assassination missions and had learned all kinds of skills. He was an expert at fighting against people, and he had learned how to be careful when he was the target.

That's why I never let my guard down, no matter what the situation is.

While hunting down Oxian and Khan, he hadn't neglected to keep a proper lookout for his surroundings.

It saved my life.

But that's it.

"Hmm, you're more powerful than me. You're more powerful than me.

What would you do?"

Competing abilities.

And the struggle for life.

Arios felt that he was alive.

The injuries he sustained have already been healed. His life force has been strengthened to an extraordinary degree, and he even possesses the power of a cutthroat angel. It's just that he still hasn't broken free from the conventions of his human days, and Arios has long since entered the realm of the inhuman.

(With this power that surpasses even the Demon Lord, no matter who you are, you're no match!)

I am proud of myself and look forward to Souei's next move.

Arios had already realized it. As Souei had said, he was more powerful than he was.

I didn't even doubt my victory, as I felt that we were not that far apart in terms of skill.

It wasn't carelessness - but it was too much arrogance against Souei.

From the beginning, Souei had never been a serious contender with Arios.

The battle must be won.

No matter how good the game is, if you lose, it's over.

That's why Souei doesn't care about how he wins.

From the beginning, he had kept his "other body" hidden and had been watching for an opening. In this way, while playing a close game, he gradually made it seem like he was going to lose, and caught Arios off guard.

While making it look like he was doing everything in his power to die, he peeled off Arios' cards one by one, building a sure path to victory.

And then the moment comes.

Hahaha!　You've been a tough opponent. You've been a tough opponent, I'll give you that. So I'm going to kill you with my special weapon!"

He then unleashed the "Divine Annihilation Bullet," a special blow that is the ultimate grant of the "King of Punishment.

He was shot through, and Souei's "other body" dissipated. Arios saw this and was convinced that he had won.

It's not unreasonable.

The "Annihilation Bomb" could only be fired once a day, but it was the most powerful means of attack. It was less powerful than the one that Lieutenant Kondo had fired, but it was still a blow that could not be shattered.

It was understandable that he thought Souei's death was certain, but that was exactly what Souei wanted.

"The Thousand-Handed Killing."

"What?"

A shadow stretched out and latched onto Arios.

"Wait, wait..."

As it was, Souei blocked his movement and destroyed Arios' heart with the twin swords in his hands.

It was Feldway's words that changed the stalemate in the war.

"I guess it's time. There seems to be no point in fighting any more."

That's what I thought when I heard it.

You should have made your decision earlier, he thought.

If we could corner him here, that would be the best. But unfortunately, if anything, I felt we were at a disadvantage.

If they continued to fight, I'm sure they would get support, but to be honest, I'm not sure. Ranga and the others would not lose, but he could not deny the possibility that he was being too optimistic. There was a hint of danger in the castle, so I was worried that they might be struggling.

Basically, I only want to play games that I can absolutely win.

And yet, I wasn't prepared enough this time.

We didn't expect that even our communications would be cut off, so we had come to the battlefield without analyzing the enemy's strength.

I had some idea of what to expect from Dino's report, but when I actually fought him, he was even more powerful than that.

It's a foul thing to overwhelm that Jahil or that Benimar.

I was expecting Benimaru to take out the enemy as quickly as possible, as he always does. And yet, we're in an unbelievable situation where it's a wonder we haven't been defeated. ......

So, well, if you're going to retreat here, I'm not going to stop you.

I don't have one - but I'll remember to stir it up here, too.

"Whoa, you're not thinking too hard about running away, are you?"

When I heard this, I peeled my eyes away from Sylvia, who was dealing with Leon. She was glaring at me with a look that said, "Don't say anything else.

Unlike Eltan, maybe she's not good at belly tricks.

In these things, the one who hides his true feelings wins.

In times of distress, the theory is to deceive others by saying the opposite.

I'm not sure what to make of this. In addition, I was able to find out the bottom of your abilities. It's a good result."

Hmmm, I guess I didn't get the chance to get into this kind of stunt.

But that is the goal.

If you sound like a sore loser, they'll feel good about withdrawing.

It would be worse for me if they said, "I quit.

So inwardly I'm thinking, "Go home, go home, get the hell out of here!" I thought, but I continued to urge Feldway on.

Well, you're freaking out, aren't you?　Well, my friends are going to come running soon. If they do, we'll win, and I can understand why you'd want to run!

As he said this, he launched an onslaught.

My words may have upset him a little, but Feldway's sword dulled for a moment. I felt my sword graze her body, but Feldway was unharmed.

Apparently, I was mistaken?

No, no, no, apparently I've been grazing a few times since a while ago. ......

The next time I see you, I will crush you with desperate force. The next time I see you, I will crush you with desperate force, so be prepared."

"That's my line!　Apparently you're not very good at Diablo, so I'll let him deal with you next!"

......"

When I said that I was going to throw away the words in a way that sounded like some delinquent comic book, Feldway was mortified. I didn't miss the look of disgust on his face.

This is the secret technique, leave it to others!

But this time it worked so well that I'm going to push it even if Diablo doesn't want me to.

Well, reading the atmosphere and observing the reactions of others are essential skills for working people. If you watch them closely, you can get a sense of what makes them happy and what makes them uncomfortable.

On top of this experience, I have been working in the construction industry for more than ten years, where socializing is very important, and I am very familiar with this kind of harassment.

It was obvious from Feldway's words and actions that he was not very good with Diablo. I thought I might be wrong, but I'm relieved to hear that I was right.

You're a real jerk, you know that?"

I'm flattered by the compliment.

"Tsk, you're on a roll. Jahil, Leon, we're retreating."

Feldway ran away from the argument with me and announced his retreat.

A psychological victory - just kidding, it's actually a tactical victory.

"Hmmm. Aren't we going to settle this here?"

"Yes. I have orders from Lord Mikael."

"Well... I owe you a debt of gratitude. I'm not in the best of shape, so I'll just go along with it.

Jahil was overwhelmed by Benimar, but he grudgingly agreed. To be honest, I thought it would be troublesome if this guy insisted, so I feel relieved.

I was thinking - Benimar started to agitate Jahil.

"Huh, you're running away?　I almost had a chance to win, but it's my inexperience that I couldn't finish you off here. I'll win next time, so keep that in mind."

I wondered what he was doing to me, but I couldn't complain since I was the one who started it first.

It hurts to see Sylvia's gaze saying, "What the hell is wrong with these people?

I understand that feeling.

I would have thought it was stupid, too, from a third party perspective. ......

"You have no idea what you're doing!　If you dare to taunt me, the Great Magician..."

"Jahil, that is the hand of that slime. If you lose your cool, you could lose a battle you could win."

Thanks, that misunderstanding!

I felt like I was spoonfeeding it to the wrong people, but if that's what you took from it, all the better.

For the first time, I felt that Feldway might be a good guy. This is probably due to my good behavior, but it seems that I was successful in making him more cautious than he needed to be.

"Hmm ......, yes. I'm going to save your face here. You'll never get another chance, kid."

Jahil also looked short-tempered, but he was surprisingly thoughtful. I was preparing myself for another outburst, but I was honestly following Feldway's lead here.

And Leon doesn't argue because he is being manipulated.

After reaching a consensus, the three of them flew away from the broken ceiling into the sky.


After seeing this off, Benimaru and I sat down on the spot, losing our strength.

In a fight, the aggressor wins, but this time I went too far. If I'm not more careful next time, it could have the opposite effect.

When I was thinking like that, Benimaru would complain to me while I was exhausted.

"Master Rimuru, it's too dangerous to stir things up in that situation!"

I felt like I had been told what to do first.

"Don't tell me you did!　I was in a hurry to see what was going to happen when you tried to stir up Jahil when we were about to settle the matter!"

No, I was just following Rimuru-sama's lead. I followed Rimuru-sama's lead. If my lord is not going to retreat, I can't pull the trigger imo. And besides, if I don't, I'll feel like I lost."

I looked at Benimaru, who was smiling, and thought that was what he really meant.

I noticed Sylvia looking at us with a dumbfounded stare, but Benimaru and I kept our heads down and acted as if nothing had happened.






◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇






Vega has escaped from Ranga, but he doesn't think he's lost.

Vega's fault is that he doesn't reflect, but his positive attitude is the only thing we can learn from him.

What Vega arrived at was the battlefield where Kumara and Orlia were fighting.

Vega hides his presence and looks around.

The decision was made quickly.

Orlia had been fatally damaged by the barrage of Kumara's tail. Fortunately for Vega, he was blown to the vicinity of where he was hiding.

(This guy is lucky. It's like the heavens are telling me to eat him!)

Vega thinks selfishly. There is no such thing as camaraderie, so there is no such thing as an auspicious attitude of helping others. This is especially true for those who have no use for him.

Vega licked his tongue and crept closer to Orlia.

"Well, you look good."

"Vega? Vega?　Thank God, he's stronger than I thought..."

Sounds like a good idea. But don't worry. I'll take care of the rest and avenge you.

Orlia thought that Vega also had a kind side to him - but he was forced to realize that this was a misunderstanding, as he immediately felt a severe pain.

The gentle touch of Vega's hand burned Orlia's skin. And then it began to erode and eat Orlia.

"Gah, what are you doing..."

"I'll eat your soul, so give me that power too. I'll eat your soul and give you the power to do the same, and then we'll be able to kill those little bastards easily.

"Mikael-sama would never allow such a thing..."

Shut up!　This world is about the weak and the strong, right?　I'm sure Michael would be more than happy to see me get stronger!

Vega shouted and laughed vulgarly. And just like that, he accelerated the erosion without showing any mercy to the suffering Orlia.

It eventually made its way to his neck, and with a gulp, he bit Orlia to death.

It's the work of the devil. ...... It's ugly.

To me, that's a compliment.

In fact, even though eating Orlia and her friends was an atrocious act of cruelty to others, to Vega it was a natural act to sustain life. He followed his instincts and used his ultimate ability, the "Evil Dragon King".

As a result, Orlia was completely decomposed by the "organic domination" and became Vega's flesh and blood.

"Good, good!　This power makes me feel stronger and stronger!"

Vega was elated and tried the authority he had inherited from Orlia.

The mythical class that he had taken in - the alien armor that covered his entire body, which had been remade with the Blue Dragon Spear through "metal manipulation", glowed blood-colored. The armor was armed like the fangs and claws of a beast on its arms, legs, elbows and knees.

This was the moment when Vega's demon form evolved into something even more devastating.

Kumara saw Vega like that, but from the start, she was on maximum alert. The reason why she threw Orlia out of the room without stabbing her was because she felt the sticky gaze and lost control of her hands.

That's how hard it was to hide Vega's evil presence.

As a result, Orlia was dead, but Vega was strengthened. It seems to be completely Kumara's fault, since he seemed to be wounded when he came here.

（I failed, didn't I? Quality is more important than quantity. I can't face Lord Rimuru by letting the enemy strengthen.)

Inwardly breaking out in a cold sweat, Kumara ponders how he can recover.

Having experienced defeats against Carrion and Frey in quick succession, Kumara was not overconfident in his abilities. It would be best if he could finish Vega here, but he understood that it was apparently out of his hands.

When you meet a strong person, you have to assess their strength. If you fail to do so, the only thing that awaits you is defeat - in other words, death.

Kumara sincerely understands that this is unforgivable. Now that she has been let out of the deathless labyrinth, she knows she must not make the mistake of getting herself killed.

So, although I am not happy about the fact that I strengthened Vega, I was able to avoid a situation that would have led to a bigger blunder.

The difference of just a moment made all the difference.

If Kumara had thrown a temper tantrum and attacked Vega, he would have been preyed upon in return. However, Kumara's decision to wait and see allowed a third party to intervene in the situation.

"We've been ordered to withdraw. Vega, the battle ends here."

A figure suddenly appeared on the scene and stopped Vega from his attack position.

That person was Mai Furushiro, who had been keeping a quiet eye on the situation.

Feldway had given the order to retrieve everyone, and had "instantaneously moved" to Orlia's location coordinates. However, she was not there, and oddly enough, she was the one who stopped Vega's outburst.

Vega obeyed meekly. She instinctively knew that she had just gained so much power that she would not be able to absorb any more food.

Thus, the Kumara crisis was over and the battle here was over.


When Mai retrieved Vega, she found that Arios was dying. His heart had been destroyed by Souei, and Arios was about to be defeated.

However, Arios and the others who had become "demons" would not die even if they did not have a heart. It is not the blood that flows through the heart, but the source of power called magical power and divine power.

As you become more skilled, you will be able to control the power at will.

However, it's definitely a critical situation, because without the heart, I can't exert much power.

In the case of Arios, the vestiges of his human life had not worn off, causing him to be fatally weakened.

If he hadn't done so, he would have been struck with a hammer and death would have been inevitable.

Who are you?"

I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.

It was Vega who answered.

"My name is Vega. I've given my name to a small fry, you can thank me and remember it."

Hearing this, Souei thought his expression was going to fall off.

In fact, Souei is aware that he is prone to losing his temper.

However, as a secret agent, this is a demerit factor, so he has learned how to separate his head from his heart and turn his anger into energy.

Normally, he would be angry, but he would also smile coldly and calmly torture his enemy, but this time it seemed to be difficult. This time, it was going to be difficult.

(This is supposed to be Vega of Power, one of the heads of the ...... "big three". What happened in this short period of time that is so different from the previous findings?)

In this world, there are times when something happens that makes you feel like a different person, and your power increases.

This is the first time I've ever seen such a thing. So, Souei also had an understanding of such cases.

But that didn't mean that he could just nod his head. Souei thought that it was necessary to clear up the question of what was happening to Vega.

However, that opportunity was lost.

He didn't want Mai to waste her time talking, so he quickly withdrew from the scene.

...... That woman, appearing without a hint and disappearing without warning, may be even more troublesome to deal with than Vega.

Souei muttered to himself.

It was Khan who nodded in agreement.

"That's probably 'instant travel. Whether it's magic or skill, crossing space requires a preliminary step. Theoretically, it is possible, but no one has yet achieved it. Theoretically, it is possible, but it is an illusory feat that no one has yet achieved.

As he walked up to the bottom of the saway, he gave his reasoning on what Mai had done.

Despite his full-body injuries, Khan's demeanor was regal. As the great demon of the demon world, he continued to express his gratitude for Souei's help.

Oxyan came over and thanked him as well as Khan.

"Don't thank me. I was only following Master Rimuru's orders."

Even though the two of them thanked him, Souei was not happy about it.

The reason is that letting the enemy escape is a big loss for Souei.

And we failed to get rid of that Arios guy. We have to assume that the enemy now knows about us, and we will have to fight harder next time. We've achieved our tactical goal of survival, but we can't all be happy about that.

When Souei responded in his usual matter-of-fact way, Khan and Oxian looked at each other. From their point of view, they were grateful just to have survived this moment.

But Souei had no time to spare, so it was natural to be wary of the next one.

Regardless, we're the ones who got the information about the enemy.

While reflecting on his failure, Souei changed his mind, saying that he needed to review his strategy for the future based on this information.






◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇






The battle was over.

The forces that had been fighting outside the castle had also relented and left the scene as soon as Feldway withdrew.

So we gathered in the conference room where we were safe.

I, Benimaru, and Souei joined the fight. And then there was Diablo.

The knight captains of Leon's forces.

And Gee and the demons.

A mysterious helper, Sylvia, who claimed to be Elmesia's mother, also joined us.

I must not forget the important witness of this time, the former demon king Kazareem, Lady Kagari. She was successfully quarantined at the last minute, so she survived without serious injury.

However, Tia, who was protecting Cagalli, was badly injured. Since the recovery medicine did not heal her, Mater, the leader of the White Knights who is good at recovery, is currently taking care of her in her hospital room.

The only way to overcome an attack carrying the ultimate authority is to use your own will. He could only pray for Tia's recovery.

I'm also concerned about Tia, but there's not much I can do about that. What's important now is the future, and that's why we're here.

Each person would report back to the other and share information about the enemy. The purpose was to review future strategies on that basis.


As soon as our eyes met, there was a guy who got involved with me.

"Mr. Rimuru..."

It's Gee.

He's going to resent me for ignoring him on the battlefield, and he's definitely going to think it's a complaint, so I'm going to use all my through skills to cover it up.

How dare you ignore me just now?"

"No, I don't like it!　I don't know what you're talking about.

You had your eye on me!

I didn't notice that at all. More importantly, I'm glad you're all okay!"

"Hey, don't change the subject. Besides, since Leon was taken, it's not like everyone is safe!

That's right.

But, well, we've already factored that in, haven't we?

"Well, well, well. We're right on schedule with Leon.

"That's the idea you were talking about. I can't help but think you're just postponing the problem, but are you sure you're okay with it?"

Maybe ......."

Gee stared at me as hard as he could.

As for Leon, he had actually thought of a plan beforehand.

As Ciel had suggested, preying on Leon and destroying the "control circuit" itself was a surefire way to counteract it.

The main reason I didn't do it was not because I trusted Leon... but because I didn't like the physiology of it.

It's not a joke ......, but the real reason was something else.

The first is to avoid alarming Mikhail.

By leaving Leon here, he wanted Mikhail to think that there was no way for us to fight him.

And the second one, this one is a strategy of hoping for the best.

"But you agreed to it when I asked you about it, right?　If Leon, who is under the control of the enemy, comes back to his senses after the attack, we can overturn the power gap at once."

"Well, yeah. I agree that the plan is reasonable, but only if Leon is safe. If you can get to the point where Leon is attacking, that will give us the advantage.

That's what I was thinking.

You're right about the postponement of the problem, and there's still the question of whether or not I'll be able to conveniently go, but if this goes well, we can easily destroy one of our enemies.

Regardless of how many troops we had, if the Leon class forces were switched between friend and foe, the battle would be as good as won. As soon as Ciel suggested this, my mind was made up.

Whatever the case, the die is cast.

Now that Leon had been taken, they had no choice but to trust in the success of the mission.

Um, is Master Leon going to be okay?"

Arlos asked, and I gave him a big nod.

Don't worry, I have the means to release you."

It would be bad enough if they were suddenly executed, but I don't think Mikael would do something so senseless. That's why I approved of Ciel's plan.

"Either way, we were out of options. Let's trust in His Majesty Rimuru. So, what's the plan now?"

Claude said, and then reestablished the situation.

Guy's still not happy, but we've achieved our goal of diverting the conversation...

But enough about Leon. Rimuru, didn't you just make eye contact with me?"

Damn, he's got his roots firmly planted in .......

Um, what are you talking about, ......?"

"Don't play dumb with me!　You're the one who ran away without even pretending to help me when I was struggling to deal with Velzard!

"I didn't run away. I trusted you, man!"

"Huh?　You're still a smooth talker. If you had just come to the rescue, we wouldn't have had to go through all the trouble!

Wait a minute, it's not my fault about that, is it?

"Hey, hey, what are you talking about without calling us?　We've been alerted, and we're responding as quickly as possible.

"What?　I'm not sure what you mean by that.

I didn't trigger it!　I mean, wouldn't you have been able to make a call in any situation with this ring?"

Yes, I was told that the Demon Lord's ring, which he gave me when I became the Demon Lord, would allow me to contact him under all circumstances.

And yet, I hadn't heard from Gee or Leon.

If Dino hadn't told me, I might have been even slower to respond. I hope he will appreciate that more.

"Yeah, that's it. That ring was made by Velzard, and he can easily sabotage it. I'm sorry, I forgot about that too."

Well, when you say it so openly, it's hard for me to respond. ......

"Well, yes. Well, let's just call it mutual this time, shall we?"

"Yeah, I guess so. It's a problem if there's still a rift between us, so let's stop fighting at this point.

That's how it happened.

There are some things I'm not quite sure about, but honestly, I don't want to get into any more trouble. I'll just have to be the adult here.

That's about it.

So, why are these people sitting on their asses?"

The people I was looking at were Rain and Misery.

For some reason, from the moment I was invited into the room, I was made to sit on the floor.

Incidentally, Leon's castle was built of stone, so the floor was also covered with marble. It was hard even on tatami mats, so sitting on the floor in such a place was considered to be quite a hardship.

"Yeah, those guys. You want to hear it?"

If you ask me if I want to hear about it, I'm at a loss.

Gee's eyes are kind of dangerous, and I don't want to get involved.

"Oh, I'm not interested..."

"Actually, these idiots were having fun drinking while we were fighting for our lives. I'm a little pissed off, and I'm trying to figure out what to do.

Yeah, that's the kind of thing... I said I wasn't interested, but I think Gee wants to bitch about it.

I mean, seriously, would you do something like that?

Is it true?"

I asked Rain and the others, not Gee.

Then Misery became distant and silent, but Rain appealed to her with teary eyes.

"No, it's not. It's a sad misunderstanding, Master Rimuru."

When I heard that, it hit me.

This is not a misunderstanding, you know.

"Don't listen. You'll get your ears dirty."

Okay. We don't have a lot of time, so let's get on with exchanging information."

I jumped at Gee's words.

The rest of the people who had been watching our conversation seemed to be silent on the matter. Diablo was the only one who shook his head in disgust, but he didn't seem to want to interrupt.

So I decided to leave Rain, who was crying, and Misery, who seemed to have reached the point of no return, and get down to business.






*






Now, I'm going to listen to everyone's opinions in turn.

The report went smoothly, although there was an extra act along the way.

Incidentally, the extra act was the exchange between Khan and Misora when they reported back.

When it was their turn, Khan and Oxian stood up, where Khan turned to everyone and said no, then bowed to Gee and said his wish.

"Normally, I understand that it would be an unforgivable sin for me to address the Red King as my master. However, I beg you to listen to me..."

He was very sincere, and Gee allowed him to speak.

In response, the Khan said, "Can you please forgive the iniquity of my Lord Misery?

This made sense to me, too.

He had been sitting on the floor for a long time during our discussion. Maybe he was okay because he was a demon, but I was wondering if it was time to let him go.

However, it was not Guy who became enraged, but Misery, the one who was being punished.

"Khan!　You lunkhead. Without forgiveness..."

He tried to reprimand Khan with great force even though he was sitting on the floor.

It was Gee who stopped him.

"Wait a minute. You've grown up enough to be able to talk to me, haven't you? That's good. I'll forgive Misery this time for her merits.

True to his word, Gee forgave Misery and ordered everyone to get something to drink.

That was all well and good, but then came the problem.

As you can imagine, Rain, who was still sitting on the floor, did it.

Now it was Misora's turn to stand up and speak, and there, like Khan, she wanted her master, Rain, released.

But Gee wouldn't allow it.

It didn't seem to be because it was the second best or for some other petty reason.

I'm also good at reading the atmosphere, so I sensed that Guy was annoyed. Misora also noticed this, and when she was told no, she quickly backed off.

Knowing when to back off is a sign of competence. I thought Misora was a very capable person, not like Rain's subordinate.

However.

There are people who can't read the air.

Why is that, Missoula?　You're better than Khan, so why are you giving up so easily?　You have to try harder to save me!　Why am I the only one who continues to sit on the floor while Misery is freed?　I don't get it!

And, well, I was screaming and screaming.

I was convinced. I was convinced that Rain was a selfish, selfish youngster.

Misora told Rain as if to warn her.

Please give up. If you keep committing more crimes..."

After being told that much, Rain finally seemed to calm down.

He glanced at Gee and seemed to understand that he was in a bad position.

"You should be a little more sincerely sorry. Do you even understand what you did wrong in the first place?"

"Yes?"

When asked by Guy, Rain tilted her head with a puzzled expression. It was cute, but now that I had seen through her true nature, I could only feel her annoyance.

Gee tells Rain with a sincerely tired look on his face.

I don't have time for this, but I'll be damned if I'm going to let you get away with it. That empty bottle you found lying around in the Kamakura, it was a rare and expensive liquor, wasn't it?　How'd you get it?　It looks like they didn't steal it, or did they mug one of their own again?

Well, if you're even doing that, you're totally a bad boy.

I mean, the devil is a mugger, how's that?

Even if you don't get involved in such shoddy crimes, I don't imagine you'll have any money problems. ......

As I was pondering this, Misora interrupted me, as if she couldn't stand to see me like this anymore.

May I speak to you?"

I forgive you.

With permission from Gee, Misora defended Rain.

Our Lord is not so foolhardy.

"Oh, my God. ......"

Rain tried to say something, but was ignored by everyone. It was an incident that reminded me of the importance of daily life.

He's a man who makes sense at the very least, so I hope you can trust him on that.

"Hmm."

In the first place, it wasn't money that Master Rain needed.

"Hmm?　Then how did this thing..."

He doesn't listen to Rain's words, but he takes Misora's complaints seriously. When I see her like that, I can't help but think that Gee is surprisingly decent.

A strange thing happened here.

"Well, well, well, that's enough of that. We are in the middle of an important conversation about the future, and Rain's punishment is insignificant.

And then Diablo took Rain by the shoulders.

It was so blatantly unnatural that not only I, but even Guy, stared at Diablo.

It's still Diablo we can trust!"

Rain's eyes twinkled as she said this, as if she was thrilled, but the others were confused.

There's something.

My gut was telling me that.

I doubt it.

Gee seemed to agree, muttering to himself.

Diablo, you can't hide things from me, okay?

"Kuhuhuhuhuhu. I'm not hiding anything from you, Rimuru-sama. It's just that I felt so sorry for him that I thought I'd give him a little help.



Instead, I stared at him. This is very effective in such situations.

Sure enough, Diablo's eyes began to swim.

I had thought that he was a demon with a weak mind, but I was right. He was immediately flustered and told the truth.

No, that fine liquor was actually a gift I gave to Rain. ......

What?"

It's funny, isn't it? Even though we've made a pact, why are you giving things to Rain when you two used to fight each other just a while ago?

You're absolutely right.

Well, now I know why Diablo spoke up so easily.

If there is physical proof of the finished bottle, we can immediately determine the distribution route. Soei is here, too, and he must have decided that it was impossible to keep quiet.

That's all well and good, but the problem is the relationship with the killer.

While Gee and Diablo were arguing, I gave Souei a look. He knew what he was doing and quickly secured the evidence.

I saw empty bottles of amazake (sweet rice wine made from demon black rice), sake, black sake, and other products with increasingly higher alcohol content.

There's no way you can buy something like this even if you pile up the money, because it's not on the market. It's only available in our country, and even if it's not Souei, we can afford to identify the culprit.

I mean, come on, .......

Um, you said you were having a bender earlier, did you drink this much?"

That's right. No wonder I'm so mad.　You should do something about it, Rimuru."

Oh, no, that makes me angry.

"No way!　We're the only ones on ...... when everyone else is working?"

I never thought I'd feel sorry for Guy, but it's the boss's job to clean up after his subordinates. The fact that he was only sitting on his hands made me think that he was very forgiving.

And yet, Rain uttered an excuse.

No, it's not. This is a necessary item for advanced psychological warfare, and we were never trying to have fun on our own!

"Psychological warfare?"

"Yes, of course. I had taken great pains to obtain these items in order to get Pico and Galasha to talk. In fact, I'd rather be praised for it!"

It's amazing, this kid. I can't believe that in this situation, she insists on claiming that it is her achievement. ......

I knew you were a primordial demon, and you don't have a half-baked mind.

Diablo also seems to support the theory that if you don't admit defeat, you haven't lost, and I feel like we're both similar at our roots.

So, Diablo. I'm curious too, this is the one you can buy with points, right?　I don't think you're going to give this to Rain for free, what kind of deal did you make?"

I'll leave it to Gee to judge Rain's claim, and I'll pursue Diablo's involvement on my own.

Yes, that's right. ......

He seemed to think that he couldn't lie to me, and he was slurring his words, but that didn't last long. But it didn't last long. After all, Souei was also there.

Get the fuck out of here.

At Souei's words, Diablo gave up.

He confessed that he had been selling the items to Rain in return for her loaning him the paintings.

So, the unidentified artist who was circulating my paintings was Rain. ......

"No wonder ......"

That's why I can't get my footing.

But it seems that my worst guess that Diablo might be an accomplice was wrong. I can't blame him if he's only providing goods, because it's a legitimate act.

However, I had no intention of leaving my sketch unattended, so I let Souei take care of that.

"Don't worry. I've already ordered Soka to search Diablo's room.

That's a bit much, don't you think?"

No, it's not. No. You have violated the right of publicity, and it is a serious crime that you deserve. A search warrant has already been issued, so there is no problem."

Work fast!

The only thing I can say is that Souei is the best.

Diablo was crumpled in shock, but I pretended I hadn't seen that.






*






While Souei and I were trying to figure out a mystery, Rain was finishing his explanation to Guy. This was annoying, but also surprising, because it was really useful information.

He was able to find out where the enemy's base was located, and an overview of the forces that had gathered there. Although it was unknown how much he could be trusted, he seemed to have gleaned quite a bit of useful information.

Most importantly, the information given at the end was important.

Even I, who had been paying no attention to the conversation, turned to Rain.

That's how I got the information from them!　In the event you're not sure what you're looking for, you'll be able to find it on the web. It's not that I'm not a good person, it's that I'm not a good person.

Leaving aside the fact that his true intentions were hidden, Rain's story was too good to ignore.

What mattered was the reaction of Pico and the others.

As a result of Mikhail's complete control, Leon also fell to the enemy. Diablo's report also confirmed that Zarario had been taken over in the process.

And yet, it seems that Piko and Galasha were not under her control. Otherwise, there was no explanation for why they were enjoying the girls' party until the end.

So, here was one solution to the problem.

I wondered if Mikhail's rule would be ineffective in isolation.

This is a very accurate information.

Perhaps, but whether it is visibility or "magic sensing", it will only be effective when the target is recognized. If so, there is a high possibility that when the controlled person leaves Mikael's sphere of control, he will not be able to recognize whether the control is established or not.

If you regularly issue orders through "thought transfer" and other means to check whether they are carried out properly, you may not have such suspicions.

However, if he secretly released Leon on the battlefield without Mikhail - he would be able to decide the outcome before the enemy knew about it.

I glanced at Gee, and he looked at me, too.

I think Lane deserves a lot of credit."

When I said that, Guy nodded reluctantly.

That's right. He's an idiot, useless when he needs to be, but he can do things you never thought he could. I hate to admit it, but that's what he did this time."

I don't like to admit it either, but there are people in this world who are good at what they do. I don't like to admit it, but there are people out there who are good at what they do.

They are so-called "geniuses", but it is a test of the ability of those who are in charge to recognize the work of these people.

If it takes away from someone's achievements, it's a problem, but if it doesn't, it should be properly evaluated.

Rain was listening to our conversation, but her eyes were moistening as she realized that she was going to be saved.

I could even feel his gratitude towards me.

I can almost hear the voice in my mind saying, "As expected of Limuru-sama.

No, he was saying it with all his might.

I knew that Rimuru-sama would understand the real me. Rimuru-sama, if you need anything in the future, please let me know!"

Even if you say it with such a crisp face, it's ruined because you're sitting on the floor. That's what's wrong with you.

I was reminded that Rain was a disappointing child, even if she wasn't by any chance.

"It's because you're acting like that that you're upsetting Gee. You need to be more reflective."

I even gave him a sincere advice.

However, I have to give credit where credit is due.

Lain's actions were not commendable, but they did produce results. Then there would be no need for further punishment.

They say that you have to be punished for what you do, so why don't you just let it go?"

"Yes, you're right. I guess I'll let it slide this time."

I nodded to Gee.

Thus, Rain's release was decided.


Freed from her seiza, Rain was being congratulated by Misora and the others.

Misery, who brought the tea, said to Rain in a dumbfounded manner.

I'll admit you're a can-do girl, but you need to work on your attitude.

Rain is proud to hear that.

"Mmm-hmm. What do you think, Misora?　Misery praised me as well. A capable woman like me, even when she tries to hide it, her abilities overflow.

As I listened to this exchange, I thought.

I thought, "She's a bad girl.

Gee seemed to agree with him.

"You know, 'can do' is not a compliment, right?"

He spat gravely.

I thought she was an excellent maid until her first highlight or recently, but she was a hell of a big deal to stun Gee. ......

While we were giving up, Rain and her subordinates were having a great time.

You're right, Master Raine!"

How can a girl named Misora stir things up, too?

That's why Rain is getting carried away.

If you're feeling deja vu, that's it.

I'm like Ms. Trainee to Ramiris.

I guess I spoiled her that way, so she grew up to be a disappointing child.

As for Rain, it seems that it is too late to correct her, even if we re-educate her now. So I decided to educate Ramiris at least so that she would not become like Rain.






*






Well, I got off on an unexpected tangent, but the discussion itself went smoothly.

So, I'll summarize what I've learned about the enemy situation.

Vega was supposed to be Yuki's companion, but it seems that he had gained power and had become very powerful. Ranga intervened when Misora and the others were on the verge of a crisis, and somehow managed to fight them off.

However, he ate the enemy named Orlia that Kumara defeated, and rapidly healed his injuries and even improved his fighting abilities.

I'm not sure of the exact numbers, but if we're only comparing existence values, it looks like it's more powerful than Ranga and Kumara.

They are said to have a low character, flattering the strong and intimidating the weak, just like a picture. However, his survival instincts seem to be excellent, and he has survived to this point, despite everything, and has acquired great power.

My impression was that he was a real pain in the ass.

Incidentally, Orlia is said to have been able to create mythical grade equipment with her own powers. It seems that unlike Vergrind, he only made it materialize, but the weapon didn't disappear even after being eaten by Vega.

It was the testimony of Fran and Kizona, the commanders of the knights under Leon, and I'm pretty sure it was confirmed by Kumara.

In other words, it should be seen that the power of "weapon creation" has been inherited by Vega. I thought it was desirable to deal with this type of thing as soon as possible, since it would become more dangerous if left unattended.

I'm a similar kind of person myself, so this is something I can really relate to.

It was a warrior named Arios that Souei defeated by surprise. Unfortunately, he was able to escape before he could finish him off.

It was an unusual blunder for Souei to make, but it seemed inevitable when he heard the story.

After all, there was a user of "instantaneous movement" on the enemy side.

I have gotten testimony from Khan about this. It was a skill, not magic.

If you can jump through space without any preliminary movement, it's tricky because you can't measure its strength numerically.

If you are skilled in this ability, you may be caught unawares, and the fact that we found out in advance that the enemy had such a partner was a big gain.

She was a girl named Mai Furushiro, and it seemed that they would have to rethink their strategy to incorporate her authority in the future.

And so far, the four of them were the weakest of the enemies, but even so, they were all crooks, which was a headache.

It seems that some of them, like Pico and Galasha, with whom Rain and the others had been drinking, were unwilling to follow them, but it seems that Michael's "control of the chief angel" has turned them into complete enemies. The key will be how to unlock this.

Well, I'm sure Ciel will be able to handle it, but a certain procedure will be required to disarm it. He may be able to defeat it at his own will, so we will have to be very careful in identifying the enemy.

And this is where the enemy really starts.

They are Velzade, Zalario, and Feldway.

There was no other word for these people but threatening.

Feldway had actually fought him, so he understood firsthand how strong he was. Apparently, he wasn't taking it seriously, and I seriously think it's a good idea to leave it to Diablo.

So, we'll talk about Feldway later.

By the way, Gee, does Mr. Velzard look okay?"

"You didn't even come to help me, you're talking like you're somebody else. ......"

No, no, no, no, it was like a lovers' quarrel there, and I didn't think a third party was wanted.

"Fuck you!"

You know what they say, "No man, no dog, no fight.

I knew I'd get a real kick out of saying this, so I shoved it in my mind.

When I asked him how he really felt about it, he replied in a disgusted tone.

"Well, he's not out of his mind. I think he's a little pent up and his main goal is to harass me."

It seems that Gee was quite desperate to keep this country from disappearing.

I'm not sure what to make of this. If he agrees to do so, it's impossible for me to impose my convenience on him.

I see. I don't think that the kind of "warding" that was used during the feast of the Demon Lords can do anything about Velzard. I'm sure there's a more powerful technique, but even so, Gee seems to have decided that it's too difficult.

That would make Mr. Gee's role very difficult."

"Hey, wait..."

Since we can't seem to handle it, let's see how good you look!

Guy started to say something, but I ignored him and went on with my story. My instincts told me that if I didn't, I would certainly be involved.

It was worth it, and Guy seemed to be convinced, though he glared at me with a grudge. I was relieved to see that, and switched my thoughts to the next enemy.

"So, Diablo. How did it go with Zalario?"

"Kuhuhuhuhu, to be honest, Zalario is a strong opponent. If we compare simple strength alone, I think he's better than Feldway."

Seriously?"

"Yes. Feldway will come on board if you encourage him, but Zarario is a cold-hearted warrior. Psychological warfare is not an option for him. It's a very uninteresting opponent, but that's why it has to be a contest of strength.

Gee agrees with this.

"Yeah. Zarario was always strong, unlike Cornu. He was also very useful in the battle against Ivalaje, the dragon of destruction.

I see. He's a solid opponent who's not prone to upsets. I guess it's common knowledge in any world that the strongest people are the ones who can't be distracted.

If they run away as soon as they are about to lose a battle, they are not a threat no matter how good they are. On the other hand, an opponent who never gives up, no matter what the predicament, is a nuisance because you cannot let your guard down until the end.

In that sense, Cornu was the former, and Zalario was the latter.

In the case of Cornu in particular, he had one excellent second-in-command, and Guy had been paying more attention to him.

Now that the Cornu group has been wiped out, there is no point in talking about it here.

Anyway, I could tell that Zalario was a threat.

And this is where Diablo starts to say something interesting.

But right after Feldway reappeared, his movements became monotonous. I thought something might have happened to him."

Diablo was suspicious, and he was keeping a wary eye on the situation. As a result, he decided that it was probably not a trap but some kind of anomaly.

What I'm curious about is the information about Feldway right after he made his move.

What was Feldway's purpose in the first place?

You didn't even fight in Cagalli's fight, did you?"

"Yes, that's right. As soon as I saw Feldway, I was under Mikhail's control, but Feldway himself was keeping a watchful eye.

Hearing this, Benimaru and I looked at each other.

If Feldway had entered the fray earlier, we wouldn't have made it and Cagalli would have been killed.

If I'm not careful, I think even Sylvia would have been in danger.

It's unnatural that he didn't move, and if he wasn't going to do anything, he didn't need to go all the way to the place where Cagalli and the others were fighting. ......

So why did you have to move?

He must have had a purpose."

"I suppose so. I mean..."

"Hmmm. Possibly, that's the theory that the reasoning was correct."

As soon as I thought of it, Gee nodded, looking convinced.

I hate to admit it, but it's all I can think about.

"I suppose we should assume that Feldway can also handle the Angel Chief's control.

It was Diablo who said this.

Gee was not happy, as if he had been told first.

What do you mean?

It was Silvia who asked, but Kagari seemed to be thinking about it, as if she had something in mind. After pondering for a while, she opened her mouth.

"Um, I don't think you're going to believe my opinion, but ......"

Cagalli seemed to understand that she was in a delicate position and started the conversation that way.

But Gee denies it outright.

"I believe you, Kazareem. So don't be shy."

Gee seemed to have recognized Cagalli as the former Demon Lord Kazareem at first glance. And yet, he was ready to listen to her without a care in the world.

In a way, it was a moment when I thought that Gee was a great big guy.

"You're as confident as ever, Guy. I'm not the Demon Lord anymore. So I'll just be Kagari."

He gave a small smile and began to talk about his thoughts.






*






To summarize Kagari's story, she had free will until Feldway arrived, and she and Leon had been discussing it in private, and had made plans to betray him.

After walking a tightrope across a dangerous bridge, he was almost ready to jump into the "magic circle for transfer" when Feldway showed up. Immediately after that, he was taken over without even being allowed to resist.

The timing was so bad that it could only be described as bad luck.

I heard that Yuki had regained his ego, so if he could have escaped to our country, it would have been a really happy ending. However, this is a story of what if, so there is no point in talking about it now.

Anyway, there was no doubt that there was a close relationship between Feldway and control.

In other words, the credibility of Diablo's reasoning has increased, but I'm not comfortable admitting it, so I'll offer a negative possibility.

The problem is the condition for activating the Angel Chief's Rule. It seems that Michael can transfer a certain amount of authority, and it may be possible to activate it from a distance as long as you can see through someone else's vision.

In my case, I was able to exert a certain amount of authority over the places I checked through my "divine eye" surveillance magic. This is one of the secret techniques that I would like to keep secret as much as possible, because it allows me to take people by surprise from a very long distance.

But, well, I should have thought that what I can do, others can do too.

That's what I thought I was saying, but Guy denied it.

It's possible. It's possible, but if it's a spatial system, or even if it's a power that affects the mind, I think the conditions for activating it would be much stricter.

I was convinced that was also true.

As I have said many times before, "spatial transfer" requires knowing the coordinates of the destination. If you can get that information, you can apply it to affect the area around the coordinates.

Or, if you know the positional coordinates, it is easy to activate the magic. When I think of it that way, it makes me feel empty that I was so happy to call it a subterfuge.

In the first place, Feldway is not the only one who is the "eye" of Mikael, which is why it is strange that Cagalli was free when he was given the authority by Mikael.

In other words, it was probably because Obera had betrayed him that Mikael had become more vigilant.

If he had been able to trigger the Angel Chief's Rule when he became more alert, he would not have needed to rely on Feldway. But since that wasn't the case, there must be a reason why Feldway was serving as Michael's "eye".

If that's the case, then ...... is it possible that Feldway was given the "control of the chief angel" as Diablo said?

Or...


I'm just guessing, but Mikael has taken in Vergrind's factor. If that's the case, it wouldn't be surprising if he was able to handle her "parallel existence.


Oh, is that a possibility?

I had thought that a certain level could even lend itself to the ability to dominate, but I hadn't expected to be duplicating the full power. However, Ciel's opinion could not be ignored, or, now that I think about it, it even makes me feel like I was dealing with Mikael.

If I thought about it that way, it certainly explained why I could use the "Reign of the Chief Angel". On the contrary, he was able to use the "Royal Citadel" as well, so it was only natural that my attacks were completely unsuccessful.

He was bluffing when he used his sword, and really didn't even need to defend himself. I was deeply relieved that he hadn't shown me his backhand.

"You're right, Gee, but if Feldway can use the exact same powers as Mikhail, doesn't that explain this whole thing?

"Huh?　Mikhail had ceded his authority to Feldway?"

No, no. As much as I hate to admit it, I think we're both capable of handling the same powers."

What?　What the hell are you talking about... or is that what you got?　Verglind's Parallel Existence?

That's Guy. He understood exactly what I was trying to say.

Gee and I both frowned at that unpleasant guess.

I hoped I was wrong, but that's why I was sure I'd hit it.

It looks like they weren't all dominated at the same time, so that's not fortuitous."

The fact that the effects of domination do not come at the same time is evident from the fact that there was a time lag between the domination of Zalario and the domination of Leon and Cagalli.

In addition, the extent of the influence of the rule is also limited. This is evidenced by the fact that Pico and Galasha, who were isolated from the outside world by the Kamakura, were also delayed in being ruled.

Leaving aside the pros and cons of Kamakura, this information is valuable. This information is valuable because it confirms that there is no control unless it is recognized by some means.

"Yeah. It's a great achievement that makes up for Rain and the others' slacking. It clearly proves that in order to dominate, you need to be able to recognize your opponent directly."

I wondered if Guy agreed with me, and he said so in a frustrated tone. The trend is to reevaluate Rain, but this will certainly be a delicate feeling.

But, well, it's a good way to properly assess the enemy.

"Well, I'm not following the story at all. ......"

I gave a brief explanation to Sylvia, who raised her hand in a reserved manner and spoke up.

Eltan was terribly smart, but Sylvia didn't seem to be so. No, maybe it's the wrong person to compare them to. The knight captains under Leon's command don't seem to be able to keep up with our conversation either.

In the first place, it's a different story about the people under Leon's command.

It doesn't matter how smart you are.

And if you don't own the ultimate ability in the first place, it would be impossible for you to understand this story.

As you can see from the fact that Eltan founded the country as a celestial emperor, I guess my daughter had more skills in such matters than Sylvia.

In fact, it seems that Sylvia is stronger than him in terms of strength, but El-tan is the one who is more insightful and responsive. It goes without saying that she has political power, so they are able to share their roles neatly.

That's why I tried to sort out the situation in my own way while explaining it to Sylvia and the others.

It seems that Mikhail has duplicated his powers and given them to Feldway. So, in effect, Feldway can only be defeated if the Royal Citadel is breached.

And since he can probably control not only the "control of the chief angel" but also the control system, it is impossible for anyone other than the ultimate owner to compete with him. If that's the case, the number of people who can take on Feldway and Mikael will be limited.

Just so you know, it's not all bad.

"How?"

My attacks didn't work on Feldway at all, but it's refreshing to know why. Also, I heard from Vergrind that the power is powered by the loyalty to the owner of the power. When Rudra was using it, he was invincible as long as the Imperial subjects were around, but it has nothing to do with Feldway. The target is probably the demon tribe, so I thought my guilt would be a little less."

Killing innocent people of the Empire was honestly impossible.

If that is really the only way to go, then the only way to go would be to divide the happiness of the many with the sacrifice of the few. ...... I thought I was prepared, but I have my doubts as to whether I could really do it. It's a good idea to take a look at the website and see if you can find any useful information.

If it's a demon tribe, it's an invader, and it's probably prepared to die to attack us. So it's only polite to resist with all your might, and it doesn't hurt my conscience.

When I expressed those feelings straightforwardly, Gee was taken aback.

Ha!　You're still talking so naively, aren't you? Well, that's all well and good, but if you think too much, you'll be the one who dies.

He even gave me some friendly advice, but I thought that Gee had a surprisingly lenient personality toward his relatives.






*






Now that we had discussed the major enemies, there was still one person left.

So, who is this Jahil?"

"That's the guy I was fighting. To be honest, I thought I was getting pretty strong, but that guy was amazingly strong. I barely survived because we had the same strong points.

When I spoke up, Benimaru took the bait.

He's always had a boisterous personality, but he's always praising his enemy, Jahir. No, well, he's not praising him, he's just accurately analyzing the enemy's strength...

It's rare for Benimaru to honestly admit defeat.

"No, I didn't lose.　It's just that I can't simply say I'll win next time."

I wondered about that, but I was relieved to see that Benimaru's confidence was alive and well.

But if there is an estimated fourfold difference in existence value, a slight difference in ability will not overturn it. It's a good idea to take a look at the actual information on the web to get a better idea of what to expect.


《......》


Well, if your mind is not defeated, you can stand up to it.

On the other hand, I was going to have to keep an eye on Benimaru to make sure he didn't do anything rash.

Gee and others seemed to like Benimaru, too. Gee and others seemed to like Benimaru, too. Then, as if remembering something, he suddenly muttered.

"Hmm?　Come to think of it, what was the name of the son of a bitch who summoned me?"

This was answered by Misery and Rain.

He was a lowly bastard who claimed to be the head of state of the Super Magic Empire, the Great Magic Emperor Jahir.

The true human race created by the Ba-Godfather, right? I believe that even the godfather had identified him as a failure because of his mental problems.

This is a person who is mentioned in various grimoires and history books, who was killed after summoning Gee a long time ago.

The books I saw in Ingrassia didn't mention him by name, but he is quite famous for his folly as the fool who unleashed the worst demon on the world.

The demon was the primordial - that is to say, Guy, Diablo and the others, so it makes sense that Eltan and Gazelle would be wary.

But now it was too late to worry about it.

Even with the worst of the demons, this is how we've become friends.

And the story goes that the fool's name is Jahil, but it's hard to believe that this is a coincidence, isn't it?

As I was pondering this, Cagalli said something surprising.

It can't be. ...... That Jahir was definitely my father.

He said that Feldway had protected Jahir, who had lost his body and had become a wandering "soul," and that he had incarnated him into Footman. From his conversation with Jahir, there was no doubt that he was Cagalli's father.

However, Silvia objected to this.

"No, no, no, that's not right.　He admitted that he and I were colleagues. He was the first high brother of Goddess, and I was the third. By the way, Luminous is in second place."

It is said that the true human race, the ancestor of which was created by the gods, is Jahil. And the true ancestor of vampires is, of course, Luminous.

I wonder if the ancestor of the Wind Spirit People is Sylvia?

I heard that there were other high brothers, but they are not confirmed to exist now. Like Jahil, they have disappeared into the history of the world.

Incidentally, Gazelle's grandfather, Gran Dwargo, the first heroic king of the dwarves, was an ancestral figure who had inherited a lot of earth spirit people's blood, and was said to have been a close friend of Sylvia's.

For the long-lived species, even historical figures are acquaintances, and that's a problem. Sylvia, Guy, and the others are such living witnesses of history. I don't think it's wrong at all.

"What?　It can't be. ...... My father was undoubtedly a wind spirit man. ......"

Cagalli was bewildered by this, but she seemed to understand that her perception was more unreliable. She seemed to be trying to figure out why such a discrepancy was occurring.

And the conclusion was reached at the same time.

"My father was in Jahil..."

It's been hijacked. That's it.

"Well, what can I say, he was a lowlife. I wouldn't be surprised if Rain and Misery failed to take care of him, but I guess that's what got him in trouble.

Cagalli, me, and Gee said.

With the three of them in agreement, it seemed that Jahir's identity had been confirmed.

"Then my father is ......."

Kagari muttered and leaned back in her chair helplessly.

We didn't know what to say to her, so we decided to leave the room quietly.






*






And that night.

Gee and I moved to a different location and had a drink together.

Incidentally, the liquor served here is the one I had stored in my stomach. It was the result of Gee's insistence that I prepare the actual liquor that Rain and the others were enjoying at the party.

I wanted to say no, but I'm a sucker for the long and short of it.

It was too tedious and tiring to be selfish with Gee, so he decided to give in and sell the favor.

Diablo, Benimar, Souei, Rain and Misery were also present at the feast.

Another person, Sylvia, joined us, and the late night secret talks proceeded solemnly.

What will we do with this country now that Leon is gone?

That is the content of this secret conversation.

Since we had been able to ascertain the enemy's strength to some extent during the daytime discussion, we were reconfirming our future plans.

The damage to the town was not that bad, but Leon's castle was badly damaged, and some people had nowhere to go. The problem was that there was no place to take the refugees.

The general consensus of the knight captains was to stay in the country and rebuild the town and castle, but if an invading race were to target this place, they would have trouble dealing with it. We don't have enough counterforce to stop them from overrunning the place.

Now that Leon is gone, the chances of this place being targeted are low, but I still think it's not a good idea to do nothing about it.

Since they're staying, why don't we just let them do what they want?

That was Guy's opinion.

I'm the one who disagrees that it would be dangerous.

But there's no point in just talking about idealism, you know.　You can ask Elle, but I don't think Sarion will accept you either."

The total population of Leon's country was less than 20 million. It would be impossible to prepare enough food to feed such a large number of people.

Well, I can live with it for a few days, but I can't help it if I don't know how long it will be.

The people of the golden land of El Dorado would be psychologically uncomfortable with the idea of being protected without working. To be away from one's work for a long time is unsettling in itself.

The idea of having them evacuated to another country was, needless to point out, unrealistic.

That said, it is also ...... possible for someone to stay behind as an escort.

"By the way, Gee, you're not going to stay here, are you?"

It's okay.

"No, you don't. I thought it was... What?"

"What the hell, I can't help it. This place is of little importance anyway, but even so, there's always the possibility that they'll target us out of spite.

No way, dude!

I hadn't expected Gee to nod so openly, so I was at a loss as to how to react.

I'm amazed at ....... I didn't realize that the terrible, ruthless, cruel Red King was such a well spoken devil. ......"

People's rumors are so unreliable, Sylvia said, surprised.

I'm with you.

"Are you guys trying to fight me?"

"Oh, my God!　I'm not selling a fight I can't win!"

"Oh no, I'm counting on you, Guy!"

......"

He stared at me with a frown.

Sylvia and I looked at each other and tried to cover it up with a friendly smile.


We agreed that Gee would defend Leon's territory, which had been a concern.

Then, Ms. Kagari arrived.

"Oh, Cagalli. Have you calmed down yet?"

"Yes, it was so long ago that I don't even remember the details now. It's too long ago to remember the details now, and there's no point in getting sentimental about it now.

Cagalli replied, but it was clear that she was trying to be tough.

Misery had thoughtfully prepared a seat for Cagalli. Cagalli sat down, returning the thanks.

So, what's there to talk about?"

It was Gee who asked directly.

I think the strength of Gee is that he can do this.

Cagalli must have felt the same way, because she opened her mouth with a chuckle.

I just thought I'd tell you what I know.

When I saw Kagari's refreshed expression as she answered, I thought.

This time, he said, the story would be longer.

He had listened to the general discussion during the day, but he had a feeling that what he was about to hear would include Kagari's private side.

So I'm going to give you a heads up.

Are you sure it's okay for us to hear about this?"

"Yes. If you don't mind, I'd be very grateful for your help.

When you say so, there is no reason to refuse.

We kept quiet and listened to Cagalli's story.

.........

......

...

It was a personal story.

The long life of Cagalli, born as a princess of a great country, was summarized.

The guilt he felt for Milim and the awe he felt for Gee.

Resentment toward Leon and its sublimation.

Hearing Cagalli's story, I almost felt guilty for having killed Clayman.

After all, the Klayman in Cagalli's story was a kind and attentive man.

I could tell from Cagalli's tone of voice that she was loved by her friends.

However, he became distorted when he was given the important role of the Demon Lord, and in the end he was used by Lieutenant Kondo. In the end, he was used by Lieutenant Kondo. As a result, he became the source of a lot of misfortune and was abandoned by the demon kings, including Gee.

And I was the one who killed Clayman...

For more information about Clayman, please visit its .......

"Oh, no need to apologize. I was the one who devised the plan, and Rimuru-dono was just better than me. After all, this is a world of the weak and the strong, and there is no need to show mercy to the loser.

That was also true.

In the first place, from our point of view, Clayman was completely evil, and if we hadn't eliminated him, we would have suffered a great deal of damage. Even if you say that there was another side to him, I can only say that it would have been so.

However, there were some things that I should have thought about in terms of how they would have been manipulated, and I may have developed some sympathy for them in ways that were not logical.

That's why I decided to tell Cagalli something I'd been holding off on telling her, wondering whether I should tell her or not.

"Actually, about Tia..."

Tia was another one of those who had given us trouble as a member of the Moderate Clowns. Not as bad as Clayman or Footman, but that doesn't change the fact that he was a nasty enemy.

But now that they had an agreement, they weren't hostile. They were not exactly friends, but it was natural for them to help as allies.

That's why we rescued her when she was about to be killed by Jahir, but Tia, who protected Cagalli, was seriously injured. She is still resting in her hospital room, and Ciel was helping her to save her.


The "informants" that made up Clayman's "core" were quarantined, but can you gather them together to make up for the missing parts of the tier?


When I was asked this question, I granted it.

Come to think of it, I had swallowed Clayman whole at the end of his life. I thought I had absorbed all of it as energy, but it seems that the residue had been 'quarantined'.

I really didn't want to leave such a thing behind, and I also thought that Clayman would be happier to return to his friends than to remain inhabiting me.

It might have been possible for Ciel to revive Clayman completely. It's also possible that the success rate would have been reasonably high if the "pseudo-soul" had been given a temporary body with the residue of the "informant" in it.

But I didn't hear the answer.

Klayman is already dead.

That was why he wanted to be a part of Tia from now on, to help her.

This was completely my own decision and ego, so I wasn't sure if I should tell Cagalli and the others. But now, I thought I should tell them.

"Oh, I see. ......Thank you for that girl, Tia. ......

Cagalli muttered and smiled sadly.






*






I thought it was just me being self-satisfied, but I'm glad Cagalli seemed to enjoy it too.

It would have been nice if the story had ended there, but...

"By the way, Rimuru. "By the way, Rimuru-kun, I've been listening to you, and I think you're being a little too self-indulgent."

"Well, ......, even the goddesses didn't do such a crazy thing as collecting the residue of the dead and transplanting it to others!

I'd forgotten these guys were here.

It would have been nice if he could have just listened to me, but he took the bait.

When did you guys become so close?"

What?　We don't get along, man. We're not bad.

"Yes, you are!　From my point of view, I'd say you're much more incomprehensible if you're casually chatting with the "Dark Emperor" who is synonymous with fear!

That's not what I'm talking about, right?

What can I say? Gee is surprisingly nostalgic.

They don't get angry over trivial things, so it's easier to get along with them than you might think, as long as you take care of the things you need to take care of.

"I knew you were crazy, Rimuru. It's more than I heard from Elle. In the first place, I thought that Guy Crimson there was a horrible demon who killed my brother Jahil in a second and became the demon king.　If it were that easy to get along with him, no one would have any trouble, right?

I didn't have a chance to interrupt him as he rambled on and on.

Seeing us, the person who was the topic of conversation said with a laugh.

I think it's quite brazen of you to say that in front of me.

Oh, I think Gee likes you too, Sylvia.

Gee has a tendency to respect people who are not afraid of him. Thinking about the future, it seemed to be a good start to a good relationship.

Anyway, I thought I had gotten off on the wrong foot, but that was not the case.

"So, Rimuru. What's up with the Kleiman residue?"

Unfortunately, Gee hadn't forgotten, so I had no choice but to explain.

"No, no, no. It just happened, didn't it?　It was just a coincidence, when I was saving you from Jahir's attack..."

I just let it come out of my mouth and misrepresented it.

I'm a little sad that I've gotten used to doing this, but telling the truth is out of the question. I'm not going to reveal my authority, and if it comes down to it, I'm going to keep my mouth shut.

That's suspicious. ...... Are you hiding something?

"Tell him more. He always keeps his mouth shut about the important things.

"Shut up, you guys!　There's a lot of things I don't understand, and I don't understand how it happened this time either!

In fact, it was Ciel who did it, right?

I don't know anything about it, you know.

That's why I don't want to be shoved into it. ......

Gee and Sylvia had never met before, but somehow they seemed to fit together perfectly. Today is the first time we've met, but Sylvia-san looks just like El-tan, so it didn't feel like the first time.

This is why the late night secret talks were surprisingly harmonious and lively.

Following the flow of the conversation, Sylvia broke the ice.

"By the way. By the way, Kagari-san, I wasn't sure if I should ask you this, but I was wondering if you could tell me about your friends."

There was no mischievous attitude, but rather a sense of determination.

What?

Cagalli, who had responded to the question, was also puzzled to see Silvia like that.

But then, as if remembering something, he opened his mouth.

I have an idea of what you want to ask me, so that's fine. Also, you don't have to address me by my name, just call me by my name.

Thank you. You can call me Sylvia, too. And now, let me tell you..."

You know about Laplace, right?

"Yes. Did you hear me, by any chance?"

"Yes. Laplace was reacting to your voice when you called him Sarion. If Sarion ......, the name of the country of the Magic Dynasty, is Laplace's real name, then I've got a hell of a person on my side ......."

The conversation between them continues.

I had no idea what they were talking about, but it seemed like they were talking about the identity of Laplace.

I'm just saying.

"What?　Laplace used to be a hero?

"Yes, that's right. And by the way, he's my husband, Elle's Papin."

...... Are you serious?"

I'm serious.

I looked at Cagalli in astonishment, and she nodded back in a really calm way.

This one feels like it's already finished sorting itself out.

And I guess that goes for you too, Sylvia.

It may have been a long time ago, but she didn't show any signs of resentment towards Kagari, even though she should have resented him more, such as the fact that her husband, whom she thought was dead, had been turned into a demon death tribe.

I'm sorry. I don't blame you for hating me, but I'm still glad I met Laplace."

I'm glad to hear that. I'm also glad to hear that, because it makes me think that his character didn't change even after he died. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.

According to Sylvia's words, Laplace could have escaped if he wanted to. But he didn't do so because he was proud to be a member of the Moderate Clown League, wasn't he?

Well, now we don't really know why. ......

Well, that's not necessarily true.

And I didn't mean to comfort him, but those words were coming out of my mouth.

It was selfish of me, but I couldn't give up hope.

Even Ciel had said that there was no chance that they were still alive. So I decided to assume that Yuki and Laplace were still alive.

In the first place, Yuki had always been a nuisance to me, but since we were both Japanese, and she had been a disciple of Mr. Shizu's, I knew that she would be shocked in some way if she saw his death.

And yet, he couldn't feel sad because he suspected that the death was a lie.

No, it's true that it disappeared right in front of me without a trace, but I can't seem to trust it.

Because I've been fooled by him many times.

That's why I'm alive.

As long as I feel that way, I don't think I need to grieve.

"That's true. The boss is really stubborn."

"I see. He was alive until now, but he never contacted me. It's only because he was reborn as a demon and lost his memory that he neglected me. It's no use worrying about such a useless man, let's change our minds!

Apparently, my words were not in vain.

I was worried that I might have said something that lacked delicacy, but if I could lighten the feelings of Cagalli and Sylvia, even just a little, then I did a good job.

And so the late night secret talks continued.

To overcome today's sorrow and win tomorrow's battle.






Interlude: The Army of Justice






When Feldway returned to the Palace of Heavenly Stars, Mikael had just returned as well.

Looks like you've been beaten to a pulp.

Yeah. There was an unexpected situation. I went out to purge the defeated Obera, but my Royal Citadel didn't work."

"What?　I was fine, but..."

"That's why. This authority is one at its core. If the people to whom you give your allegiance are set to the demon tribe, it means that there is no one who knows about the rest.

What about me?

"Well, that's against the basic principles of authority. It would be natural for your loyalty to be nullified."

The two of them reported each other's situation as if they were having a casual conversation.

It was a surprise to Feldway that Michael could not use the Royal Citadel. However, he was able to figure it out without any major damage, so that was good.

What I was more concerned about was what the traitor Obera was up to and how it would end.

So, what happened to Obera?"

"Unfortunately, she escaped. Obera's men were admirably loyal and successfully kept her safe from me."

It's a shame we've lost so much of our strength, Mikael said matter-of-factly. Even though he had killed them all himself, his attitude was as if he were someone else.

The army under Obera's command was excellent. We certainly lost a regrettable force."

Even Feldway's answer was so bland that it was hard to believe that it came from the heart.

In fact, Obera's subordinates are loyal only to Obera, so they were not related to Feldway. That's why I don't think it's a big loss for us to lose him. He decided that it would not be a problem since it would not affect the Royal Citadel at all.

This cold-heartedness is the reason why Feldway is not well-liked. Feldway, however, did not care about this and continued to be a rationalist to the fullest extent.

It was different in the past, but there was no trace of that time left in Feldway now.

"Well..."

Mikhail changes the subject.

Turning to the newcomers, Leon and Jahil, he saw that their numbers were down from before the sortie, nodded one big time, and began to speak.

I think we need a chain of command for our forces. Feldway, you're the commander-in-chief, of course, but I think we should think about who should be placed under you and how, don't you?"

When asked that, Feldway nodded, "Hmm.

That's right. Now that we've talked to the last person we were negotiating with, let's decide what we want to do before we start the invasion.

Thus, once again, the main members of the celestial world, excluding the forces of Zelanus, gathered in the audience hall.






*






First, Feldway presented the results of the current operation.

Mikhail nodded at that. He had already heard the story, so this was just a formal exchange for Dino.

"Well, Orlia was killed in action."

Dino gave an absent-minded comment. The fact was that Vega had eaten him, but he omitted such an explanation.

Dino had never known her, but she was still a friend. He closed his eyes lightly and prayed for Orlia's soul, thinking that he would be allowed to at least mourn her.

Dino was followed by Piko, Galasha, and Mai, while the rest of the group kept their heads down. No one seemed to question such a tenuous relationship, and the meeting began without further ado.

Feldway took over as moderator.

Mikhail, not wanting to interfere, remained silent and watched the proceedings.

On the agenda this time was the appointment of positions.

The purpose was to clarify the hierarchical relationship so that it would not interfere with the full-scale invasion.

Vega was the only one with an ambitious look in his eyes, while the rest of the group was indifferent. Dino, for his part, looks blatantly unmotivated and small to avoid being forced to take responsibility.

It was under these circumstances that Feldway's presentation began.

As the main superior, there is Michael.

He named Feldway himself as the Supreme Commander and Chief Executive Officer.

As an advisor, Velzade.

She decided that if she was allowed to roam freely, it would be enough of a fetter to block Guy's movements.

Of those who remained, only nine, led by Zalario, were strong enough to be commanders.

No, there's another one.

The last one, though not here, was an old acquaintance and friend of Feldway's.

Including him, there were ten people in total.

Normally, a commander would need to have a tactical perspective, but on a battlefield where individual strength is important, strength is all that matters. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're going to do.

It was completely wrong, but it had worked so far. So, without feeling any hesitation, Feldway set the pecking order in order of strength.

Along with myself, the strongest person is an old friend who is not here. Zalario and Jahil followed.

Feldway decided to appoint these three as the new "Three Devils". "First of all, I'm going to appoint a new position to replace the Three Devils, the Three Star General. As Lord Vardanava's general, I want you to exert your power to the fullest."

The reason for the name change is that there are two non-Demon people in the group.

The star, of course, meant the "Star Dragon. It was a title intended for him to work as a general to revive Vedanava.

Corne is dead and Obera has betrayed us. In place of both of them, we will add Jahir. The other is expected to join the war soon, and we will appoint him at that time.

As soon as he declared that, there was an outcry of discontent.

Vega.

"Hey, hey, you're putting me in charge and appointing some random guy to be the supreme commander of the Heavenly Army?　That doesn't sound right to me!

This time, Vega, who had gained strength by eating Orlia, was getting carried away again. He is a very disappointing man who seems to have lost the concept of remorse.

The only person who could handle such a Vega well was Yuki, but Feldway didn't care.

Shut up. My decision is absolute. The next time you have an opinion, I will execute you.

Feldway has no idea about utilizing human resources.

He has a very clear idea of whether something is useful or useless, and if it is not, he throws it away.

That's why he's not popular, and Feldway doesn't care about that. The next time Vega crossed him, he was going to get rid of him for real.

Vega, who has excellent survival instincts, detects the presence.

Vega was wrapped up in a universal feeling that he was getting stronger, but Feldway's strength was in another dimension itself. She understood that she was not yet a match for him, so she had no choice but to retreat quietly from this situation.

I'm sorry, man. I wanted you to appreciate me more, so I interrupted you. ......"

With that, he mended the situation and stifled his frustration.

However, I had to grin when I heard Feldway's next statement.

"Don't be so rotten. "Don't be so rotten, I also think highly of you. That's why I'm giving you the position of the first of the Seven Evil Generals."

"Seven Evil Heavenly Generals" was also a name that was supposed to consist of the ultimate holders of the angelic lineage. But unfortunately, there were not enough of them. Feldway, who didn't care about the details, decided to designate the remaining main force as the "Seven Heavens" in order to make up the numbers.

Originally, the plan was to appoint Cagalli and Obera as the Seventh Heaven, and Vega was to be included in the force as the Four Star General.

The plan was to have Mai and Orlia act as auxiliaries and play the role of rangers. Unfortunately, from the very beginning, the plan had been drastically modified.

Anyway, Zalario, Jahil, and one other person were designated as the "Three Star Generals. The "Seven Heavens" were determined to be Vega, Leon, Dino, Pico, Galasha, Arios, and Mai Kojo.






*






Now, the "Three Star General" would be in charge of each of the legions, while the "Seven Heavens" were informed that they would be engaged in single and multi-person operations.

After that, I'll start explaining the operation.

"Now that we've brought Leon into the fold, we can say that we've broken one of the Demon Lord's forces. This means we have one less point of attack."

In response to Feldway's words, Mai projected a miniature of the Axis World and lit up five points of light on the ground. One of them, the white light spot on the continent that was Leon's dominion, disappeared.

There are only four places left.

But then, Feldway pointed to a point.

Mai changes the color of that light spot from white light to red light.

"We don't need this place either. For my friend has promised to help me, not Gee."

And what the erased point of light showed was the far west, the territory controlled by Daguerre.

You don't think Daguerre has switched sides, do you?"

It was Leon who asked that question.

The one who nodded was the third of the "Three Star Generals". He was a slender man with an exceptionally large physique.

"I'm here, Feldway. You're very bold to free me from the seal."

The man was not Daguerre.

His long, shaggy hair is green. His long, shaggy hair is green, and he is not the same person as Daguerre, who has dull blue hair. His eyes shine like jade, which is also different from the blue-eyed Daguerre.

However, they had a vaguely similar appearance.

The man's name is Feng.

He was the younger brother of Daguerre, the Wrath of the Earth, and a giant god of the Mad Fist who had been sealed away in Verdunava after a rampage in ancient times.

The first person to react when he saw Feng was Dino, who was usually very laid back.

You're lying, you broke the Holy Demon Seal's chains that bound Feng?　I'm not sure what you're thinking, Feldway, when Daguerre had been so vigilant!

He chided Feldway in a rare moment of clarity.

His tone was raspy with the momentum of his surprise.

"Don't worry. Fenn and I are friends. Our interests are aligned, and..."

Feldway stressed that Feng's ability was tremendous.

The amount of magic element that he had no intention of hiding was leaking out as a supreme energy that overwhelmed the others. In terms of existence value, it exceeded sixty million, and it was so huge that it could be said to be comparable to a "dragon species".

However, there was someone else besides Dino who was uncomfortable with Feng.

"Chi, an evil god sealed away in ancient times. It's the kind of tyrant that even I wouldn't want to deal with, let alone the gods!

Jahil spits out in abhorrence.

He did not know the man directly, but had been told about him by the godfather.

According to him, he is an evil god who was sealed in Vedanava with all his destructive power.

In Jahir's mind, he was the second most evil incarnation of the dragon after Ivalaje, the dragon of destruction.

That myth was now standing right in front of him. Faced with this fact, Jahil was disgusted to the point of nausea.

But Fen doesn't care.

With a grin, he put his arm around Jahil's shoulders and whispered in his ear.

"Hey, hey, hey. We're friends, right?　Let's get along. I heard. I've heard that I'm going to be named "General of the Three Stars" just like you. You've got a lot to prove, unlike the rest of them. You're more than qualified to be my servant."

It was a statement that completely put down Jahir.

Jahil shuddered in humiliation.

For Jahil, who believes that he should be the one to reign as the emperor, being looked down upon is an unacceptable situation.

But he couldn't complain.

He could feel the desperate pressure of the arm around his shoulder.

A cold sweat appeared on Jahil's forehead, and he returned to his chair, his hips almost floating.

"Hmph!　I forgive you for now. I don't intend to end up like this either, but for now, let's leave things as they are.

He spat it out and agreed to work for Feng.

If that's the case, I'm wondering about the reaction of the remaining Zalario, but this one doesn't seem to have any intention of fighting in the first place. This is not only because it is under the control of the Angel Chief, but also because the warrior Zalario knows his own strength.

Whether we can win or not, we will never know until we actually fight. However, if it was an all-out battle, the damage to each side would be enormous, and there was no doubt that it would affect the future of the war.

It is, quite frankly, useless.

That's why Zarario ended the situation by breaking himself.

Thus, Feng was appointed as the first "General of the Three Stars".


Then, once the actors were in place, everyone's eyes turned again to the miniature of the base world.

"So, Feldway. What do you mean Daguerre is not a problem?　I understand that Mister Feng has joined our ranks, but that is not a problem that can be solved by itself.

When Jahil pointed this out, Fen replied with a smirk.

"Oh, come on, that's sad. You're underestimating my abilities, aren't you?　If you know me, then you know this, right?　Daguerre is my brother, but I'm more powerful than him.

Jahil replied to Fen with a wry comment.

"I don't need that kind of boasting. If you really don't have a problem with it, just show me the results and I'll be fine."

Jahir is arrogant.

Even though he acknowledged Feng's ability, he had no intention of abandoning his pride as an emperor to follow him.

Fen seemed to like Jahil like that and grinned at him.

"You know me, and you still have that attitude. All right, I'll live up to your expectations.

Feng smiled happily.

He hadn't even had the chance to talk to anyone since he had been sealed away in Verdunava so long ago. Even so, the scenes of the world had been flowing into his mind as if he were dreaming.

This was because he was connected to his brother Daguerre and his other brother deep in his "soul".

That's why he has some understanding of the world situation. He knows that we are on the verge of the dawn of the Warring States Period and that the environment is ripe for him to go on a rampage.

Feldway was the only one who was willing to visit Fen, who was sealed up.

As for Feldway, he was only taking care of Feng because he was entrusted by Verdunava. But at some point, they began to exchange small talk, and before long, they began to consult with each other.

Feldway had no relatives to consult because he was at the top of his game.

Fen also realized that loneliness was lonely during the long sealing process.

In a sense, it was inevitable that they would come to trust each other.

Now, Fen had a place to play and a friend to show off his abilities.

There was no way Feng wouldn't stick it out.

It's not that Fen is less rabid than he used to be, it's just that he's simply more willing to take care of his friends.

Fenn was more than happy to have a friend. So, even though it looked like this, he was grateful to Feldway from the bottom of his heart.






*






Fenn announced that he would take on Daguerre, but Dino was still not happy about this.

"Wait, wait, wait!　Are you sure you want to do this, Feldway?　If we let Feng go, won't we lose the reason why Daguerre is guarding the Tentong Pavilion?"

Tentongkaku is a staircase leading to the Palace of Heavenly Star. Those who do not have the key to open the Great Gate have no other way to get to the Palace of Heavenly Stars but through the Tentongkaku.

It was Daguerre who was guarding it, and the reason was to keep Fen from being released into the world.

If Fen were to attack, Dino said, it would be troublesome depending on the outcome.

"Even though he was under the control of the Angel Chief, Dino's thoughts were free. If he was more strongly influenced by the control, it would be a different story, but he could at least say whatever he wanted.

Incidentally, this was also true for Leon.

His actions were constrained, but his thoughts remained unchanged. This is why, even during the battle with Sylvia, he was able to minimize the damage by not attacking extensively.

I also tried to signal her with my eyes, but unfortunately, Silvia didn't understand me. But unfortunately, she didn't understand me. It wasn't so much that Sylvia didn't understand me, but rather that she was also full of things to do.

However, even if they had been able to communicate with him, the information would have been limited to "Leon still has free will," so I don't think it would have been of much use. ......

Anyway, at the moment, the "Reign of the Chief Angel" only restricts their actions, but allows them to think freely to some extent.

For Feldway, however, it was more convenient.

Dino's comments were welcome, as no strategy meeting could be held without flexible thinking.

"That's an opinion that needs to be heard. So, what do you think I should do to alleviate some of that anxiety?"

"No, I don't know what you mean. ......"

Dino's momentum quickly dissipated when he was asked back.

I was so surprised that I spoke up, but after thinking about it, it wasn't to my detriment. I'm back to my roots, wondering what I've gotten myself into.

"No, no, no, ......, you can't ask me something that difficult, can you?

Anyway, safely, Dino tried to sit down as if his part was done.

But Feldway would have none of it.

I believe in Fen, but Dino certainly has valid concerns. So I think the best solution here is to send some other people."

You were going to do that all along, Dino thought. You've been planning to do that all along, Dino thought, and now you're saying that you don't trust Fen.

And in this case, Dino, the speaker, could be forced to participate. ......

Dino's prediction was right on target.

'Dino is worried about you, isn't he?　By all means, you should see with your own eyes how strong Feng is."

"Oh, no, I'm that ......."

Don't be shy. You won't get a chance to play, but if you want to see how strong I am, I won't stop you.

I thought it wasn't, but it was already too late. Dino gave up and nodded reluctantly.

I'll take your word for it. Then I'll take your word for it and join Pico and Galasha in the fight.

"Hey, hey, Dino!　Don't drag us into this!"

"No, really, seriously. I just had a fight to the death with Rain.　Don't you think it's cruel to ask me to fight again?"

Dino's companions criticized him for this, but he ignored them. He figured that these guys were probably slacking off anyway, and forced them to get involved in order to distribute the work.

Feldway has no objection and approves it.

It was true that he trusted Feng, but Daguerre was also a strong man. Not only is he not someone to be taken lightly, but Daguerre has another brother.

The story of the three giants who ran rampant in ancient times was well known. As the one who knows the truth of this legend, Feldway is ready to make the best move.

"Leon, I need you to join us. In addition to Feng, there are four other Seven Heavens attacking the Tentong Pavilion. I think that should be enough."

Thus, the members of the next target attack were decided.






*






This seemed to be the end of the meeting, but instead of that, we moved on to the next agenda.

Now then, let's set our next attack point.

"What?　Isn't it time to attack?"

Yeah. The plan is to invade simultaneously, taking full advantage of the aggressor's advantage. Or rather, I'm sorry Fen, but you're just a decoy."

"Bait is ...... then, where's the real deal?"

I'm not interested in the mission, but Dino thought I'd like to hear about it if we get this far. He thought it might make him feel a little better if the other places of attack seemed harder to get to.

Besides, if he could successfully meet up with Limuru, there was a possibility that he could sell him a favor with useful information.

It's not my character, he thought, but he asked the question to Feldway.

"The first thing I want you to remember is our purpose."

That was the answer.

What was the purpose, Dino thought.

It must have been a ridiculous story about resurrecting Verdunava. Well, Dino would be happy to see it come back, but...

(Doesn't Lady Verdunava have her own reasons?　(Isn't it possible that Feldway has become troublesome and he doesn't want to deal with it, or that he wants to back off until the humans have matured?)

Dino thought that it would be unwise for us to make any selfish discoveries about Vedanava, the creator and transcendent being.

(Those who speak for the word of God are the most troublesome, aren't they? (The most troublesome thing about being a spokesperson for the word of God is that they can distort your opinion if you openly state a different interpretation. It seems that Luminous had a hard time with this, and that's why he said he stopped appointing humans as the pope. ......)

Even if you hear the exact same words, there can be a difference in the perception of the person receiving them. People believe only what they want to believe, so even when they are wrong, they are reluctant to admit it.

As a matter of fact, Luminous has never once claimed to be the only god. Yet, for some reason, his followers began to say that Luminous was the only god. Luminous seemed to find it more convenient and didn't deny it, but the fact that the truth changes when people intervene with their interpretations is troublesome if it is handled in the wrong way.

After observing the human world for so long, Dino had learned to feel it. And yet, his colleagues were setting a bad example of this, and he felt like giving them a break.

In order to revive Lord Verdunava, the only element that remains is the Verdra factor. However, there is one more obstacle that must not be forgotten here. Isn't that right?"

Is that right?　Dino is a stranger.

And yet, Feldway's gaze was on Dino.

(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!　Give it to someone else!)

With that in mind, I looked around and saw that everyone kept a serious, blank expression on their faces.

Zarario seems to be rooted in the fact that he was dominated, and is ready to ignore Feldway completely.

Leon, for example, had just arrived and wasn't following the conversation, and didn't seem to be interested in it in the first place.

The same goes for Feng and Jahil. There was no way they knew the answer to the question, since it was new to them.

Pico and Galusha were unconcerned. They hid behind Dino and looked down, happy to see him.

The other "Seven Heavens" were not Feldway's friends, but rather useful pawns. They didn't seem to be the target of his opinion, and it was Dino's role to deal with them.

(No way!　Because of the disappearance of Kagari and Yuki, I've been put in charge of the brain?)

Wait a minute, Dino thought.

That should have been Zalario's role. Dino finally realized that he had been left in the lurch without realizing it.

But that doesn't mean you can't do anything about it.

I didn't want her to get her hopes up, so I decided to play it safe.

Do you hear that?"

He laughed and replied thoughtfully.

With that, Feldway nodded in satisfaction.

(I knew it. (I knew it. He's too smart for his own good and doesn't want other people's opinions. I thought that if I just gave him some praise, we could have a conversation!)

Dino nodded back, thinking that he had done it.

You're right. Dino is right, we have to get rid of this irregularity called Masayuki. If, by any chance, Rudra is resurrected using Masayuki as a medium, there is no guarantee that Mikael-sama will not be affected.

I didn't say anything..." he thought, but Dino was careful not to show it on his face. And then he nodded his head.

I also think that the logic is strange, but I'm not so good-natured as to point it out here, so I'm inclined to let them do what they want.

The others were similar, and no one else had an opinion.

Feldway continued his explanation.

As Verdra is deep in the labyrinth of trouble, the next target should be Masayuki. If we do that, and reduce his strength one by one, he'll have no choice but to come out of his cave.

If they don't come out, Feldway said boldly, we can just cut down the other forces.

I'm also close to Masayuki............ I want to tell them that they are being targeted somehow, but I can't think of a way to do that now that Mikael's control has been strengthened.

Even the "thought transfer" with Limuru could not be carried out, as this would be a clear act of betrayal. The only thing left to do was to hope for a great coincidence at the site, but Dino resigned himself to the fact that it was impossible.

All that was left to do was to pray that they would get away safely.

So, do you know where Masayuki is?"

'Good question, Dino. About that, Velzade."

"Yes, yes. From Verglind's presence, we have a rough idea of her location. There are several locations in the Empire and one in the Kingdom of Ingrassia where she has been detected. My supremacy is completely concealed, but my eyes can't be fooled."

The "white ice dragon" Velzard's cognitive ability is equal to or greater than Mirim's "dragon eye". I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you.

Vergrind seemed to be using "parallel existence" to fortify the empire's defense. At the same time, it was assumed that he was also guarding Masayuki.

Mai manipulated the miniature light spot in response to Velzard's statement.

Following the far west ruled by Daguerre, the area near the center west ruled by Luminous changes from white light to red light.

Feldway pointed at the red light.

"That means that Masayuki is here in Ingrassia. I'm going to leave it to you, Vega, to attack there, how about it?"

What do you think?" was not a question, but an order to do it. He was only saying that to lift Vega's spirits as much as possible.

Vega is too simple to realize that.

He grinned and nodded happily.

I'll take care of it. It's an old haunt, and there are many hidden passages that no one knows about. I'll sneak in and get rid of that kid, Masayuki."

Hmm, Feldway nodded.

The plan was to let Vega run amok as a diversion, and have Arios kill Masayuki while he was at it, but he thought it was possible.

Either way, he was planning to go to the royal capital of Ingrassia himself. Therefore, Feldway decided to let Vega do as he pleased and watch the enemy's movements.

Of course, that's not all.

"Zarallio, you are to lead the entire army to our support. Find out what Luminous is up to, and if she moves, stop her."

What if we don't move?

Stand by. Depending on my orders, you will launch an all-out assault on King Ingrasian City."

All right.

Feldway's orders are absolute.

Zalario put his frustration to rest and nodded meekly.

In this situation, the only one who has not been ordered to do anything yet is Jahir. It is not possible to leave a force called the "Three Star General" idle, so Jahir waited for Feldway's words while preparing himself.

"And just to be clear. Jahir, you are a ranger. I'll leave you in charge of my men, and you can move to help Fen."

"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.　I don't think that's necessary.

"Don't be so sure, Fen. Don't be so sure, Fen, it's just a precaution. Once you've taken control of Dagrule, you'll have an army of your own, won't you?"

Oh, dear.

But as long as Daguerre is alive and well, there will be times when the legions of giants will get in the way.

Is it my job to stop it?"

That's exactly what I'm saying.

He boldly states that Fen is unnecessary, but in this case, Feldway is right. As for Jahil, there is no loss either way.

If Fen is active, you can just watch him, and if he's in danger, you can ingratiate yourself with him and see it through.

Besides, there was no need to be in a hurry to succeed, because the opportunity to play an active role would come even if there was no hurry.

"Hmm!　I'm not happy that I'm not the one who trained them, but it can't be helped. As soon as I see Fen's victory, I will attack from the west to the center, is that alright with you?"

All right, have it your way.

As soon as he heard that, Jahil also shut up, saying that the conversation was over.

Jahil is an ambitious man. Even if it is his stomach to do as he is told, he is indebted to Feldway. Considering the difference in strength, he thinks it would be wise to follow him for now.

Incidentally, Velzard is directly under Mikhail, so Feldway has no right to give orders. And at present, the policy was that it was better to let her do as she pleased rather than to follow her freewheeling ways.

Thus, the roles of each were defined.






*






Once the policy was set, Mikhail opened his mouth.

I have one more thing to tell you. It's a labyrinth in the Demon Lord Limuru's domain, and it's extremely troublesome if you're trapped in it. As Feldway said, it's better to lure them out. So, I decided to give the sphere of influence of the Demon King Mirim, centered on the former Eurasia, to Zelanus. If a war broke out in his land, whether it was the royal capital of Ingrasia or the territory of Mirim, the Demon Lord Rimuru would not be able to ignore it. He would not be able to ignore it. If you do, there is no doubt that we will be victorious."

Mikhail's words were full of conviction.

In fact, this is the greatest advantage for the aggressor. The destruction of the enemy's forces by destroying them individually. If you do this repeatedly, you are guaranteed victory.

In addition, once the bases other than the capital city of Limuru are eradicated, the siege will be complete. There are many mysteries in the labyrinth of Ramiris, and it is possible that there is more than one way in and out, but being able to stop the logistics is a big deal.

It might be possible to bring in strategic supplies and the like, but it was easy to reduce their influence once they were cut off from the rest of the world.

However, since the ultimate goal is to take in Verdra's factor, we can't just wait and see.

As it was, Mikael decided that it would be best to bring the situation to that point and then slowly plan a strategy.

This may have been the right strategy, but Dino was not convinced.

"Hey, hey, hey. Mirim is the daughter of Lord Verdunava.　Do you understand that?"

I complained as if I were letting my indignant feelings get the better of me.

But Mikhail remained aloof.

Is... is there a problem?

Without losing her cool expression, she asks Dino back.

"What's the problem? No, no, no, I'm talking about whether or not you're going to displease Lord Verdunava. ......"

It was a natural question from Dino's point of view.

It would be an act of betrayal to Verdunava to touch Mirim. And yet, what was Mikhail thinking?

However, Mikael's reaction was very nonchalant, and he seemed to really think that there was nothing wrong with it. And the same was true for Feldway.

"Dino, I think. "I think, Dino, that the Demon Lord Mirim, daughter of Lord Verdunava, is no different from us in that she was created by him.

I am sure that this is what Mikael and Feldway really feel. Their respect and loyalty was directed only to Verdunava, and they didn't seem to have even a shred of affection for the girl.

Jahir seemed to agree, sniffing and sneering at Dino with a mocking look.

Having been destroyed by the wrath of the Mirim in the past, he was delighted by the invasion of the former Eurasia. Dino's opinion, which seemed to interfere with that, was not amusing to Jahir either.

(Hey, hey, that's why Obera betrayed us!　These guys really have a bad way of thinking. ......)

Dino thought as he looked over at Feldway.

If he didn't, even he could be branded a traitor.

It was to Dino that Feldway told him.

"Don't worry, Dino. Don't worry, Dino. If my actions are wrong, He will come back to correct them. If it is my beloved daughter who is in danger, He will surely come to her rescue. So, my actions are right."

Dino had no words to say when he was told that much.

His former friend was dead. If he had realized this earlier, he would have been able to escape... Dino regretted it now.


Thus, the outline of the Tenma Taisen was decided upon and carried out.

And that day...

The world's situation is about to change drastically due to a great disaster that will throw the world into a whirlpool of chaos.

CHAPTER 2

After the discussion that night, it was decided that Cagalli and Tia would be kept in our country.

Tia was still unconscious, and the safest place to take care of her was inside the labyrinth. It's a good place to get detailed information and find out if there's any malicious intent at work.

So it was only natural that Cagalli would follow me. I decided to accept both of them without any complaints.

Ms. Sylvia returned home to Salion.

I can help her as a warrior, but what's important to her is Sarion, where her daughter is. I can't impose my convenience on her, so I promised her that we would cooperate with each other if something happened.

I also gave her my cell phone, just in case. El-tan has it, but I decided that it would be better to have Sylvia have it as a backup.

The communication function of the Demon Lord's ring was not universal, and we should secure as many means of communication as possible.

After this fiasco is over, I can use it for fun.

After exchanging our contact information, I saw Sylvia off.


And now I'm in the Oval Office.

I had accumulated so much paperwork that I almost felt as if daily life had returned to me.

Just seeing that seemed to increase his anger at Feldway by about 30%.

You see, I'm not playing around either. And yet, there are piles and piles of plans that need my approval, and minutes of various measures that are being taken.

For now, I'll put off the minutes. They've already been done, so there's no need to rush to look at them.

He looked over the new projects that needed to be approved and quickly decided whether they were acceptable or not.

I'm busy, but I have no choice.

After all, the day after tomorrow, a world conference will be held in the Kingdom of Ingrassia.

Yes, the World Congress.

This would be the first such feat in history.

The participation of His Majesty the Emperor of the Empire of the East in the Council of Western Nations, which is held regularly in the West, is a major event that has never happened before.

In fact, I had planned to meet up with Mjolmire in the Kingdom of Blumund and go with him. But because some idiot attacked Leon's country, our plans were greatly disrupted.

It was a mistake to have the paperwork shoved in my face like this to fill in the gaps.

But that's over now.

All that was left to do was to sip on some tea and then relax.

I'm going to try to calm down and collect my own thoughts before the show.

"Tea, Master Rimuru."

It was Diablo, not Shuna, who brought me a cup of tea. Perhaps because Sion was not here, he was working hard as a secretary.

"Thanks, man. You take a break with me, too."

I said, and suggested that Diablo sit facing me.

Passing over Diablo, who seemed to be impressed with the honor, I started to talk.

So, what kind of guy is Feldway, in your opinion?"

From what I could tell, he seemed surprisingly unpopular.

Otherwise, Dino wouldn't have betrayed him so easily.

Anyway, what we need is information about the enemy.

If you know what kind of personality they have, you will be able to judge how far they are willing to bluff, and so on, when the time comes.

He understood well enough to be cautious, so he thought he would ask if there was anything else he could do.

Diablo ponders and then answers.

He's a serious guy. He's hard-headed, inflexible, or whatever you want to call it, but once he's convinced, he won't bend his will. He has a personality that doesn't need other people's opinions, even to the extent of reference, so his peers were divided in their evaluation of him.

In other words, for a yes man, it's easy to be a boss because he only has to do what he is ordered to do, while for a brilliant and creative person, it's like an uninteresting boss who ignores his opinions.

It's very stressful when your opinion is not accepted. If there is a good reason and it is explained to me, I will be satisfied, but if it is just one word of rejection, there will be resentment.

Is there anything else?"

When I asked him that, Diablo muttered, "Well, ......" and began to worry.

Then he prefaced his speech with, "I'm not sure about this," and went on to say something more important than I had expected.

To put it simply, how to get back and forth between their base and this world.

They - the invading race - are a metamorphosis of those who were banished from this world by the Vedanavas and the legions of angels who were their watchers.

Its base, of course, is in the Otherworld.

The link between that other world and this one, the axis world, is a special force field called the "Underworld Gate," and there are several of them around the world.

It was the demons that guarded, or rather controlled, the gate. Surprisingly serious, they were expanding their sphere of influence around the "Underworld Gate".

Only one gate is known to exist, the Gate of the Underworld, which was guarded by Carrera, not far from Leon's territory.

The point that was guarded by Testarossa and Ultima had disappeared due to a major battle.

It would be better if there were no such thing. If you go to the other world with your body, you will be contaminated and transformed. It's almost certain that those who come here from the other side are an invading race.

He said bitterly.

In short, it's easier to destroy the gate itself because it causes chaos in this world.

The ones who didn't like it were Testarossa and Ultima. They had been guarding it as a base for a long time, but when Diablo went to scout for them, they were broken, so he was able to recruit them easily.

I thought, "That's a lie, isn't it," but I didn't say anything. As proof of this, the "gate" that Karela was guarding seemed to be on the verge of breaking down.

And it seems like they're just letting it go because currently, beings with a lot of power can't come and go.

I secretly wondered if it was correct to assume that he had broken it on purpose.

So, back to the topic at hand, what Diablo was wondering was how Feldway and the others had come to this world.

Diablo speculated that perhaps a new "gate" had appeared somewhere in the empire.

Or did you restore the gate that Testarossa was guarding?

I can't deny that possibility," he said. However, it doesn't match the time when Feldway appeared in the Empire, so the existence of another Gate is certain.

Hmmm... I guess that makes sense.

"So you're assuming that the invading race has a stronghold inside the Empire?"

So I confirmed that, but what Diablo was concerned about was something else entirely.

"No, that's not all. From what Cagalli told me, there is no doubt that Feldway has opened the gates to the Celestial Palace. To open it, he'll need the key..."

"The Palace of Heavenly Stars" - also known as the place of the beginning, the birthplace of Verdunava, right? As Cagalli explained, Feldway's base is adjacent to every world.

So, what Diablo was wondering was how to get that key...

There's no point in worrying about how you got it. What matters is that once you pass through the gates of the Palace of Heavenly Stars, you can come to the Axis World as the body that exists in the other world.

Oops, I'm glad I didn't word it because it was way off.

Anyway, what is the main body that exists in the other world?

Of the Primordial, only Feldway was given a physical body by Lord Verdunava. The current one is merely inhabiting a temporary body, so killing him would be pointless."

Something like Verglind's Parallel Existence?"

No, it's not like that. It's not like you're connected all the time, it's like you're splitting your consciousness. You're probably synchronizing your memories on a regular basis, and there's no inconvenience. ......"

That's why it's so much trouble, Diablo explained.

As I understand it, Vergrind is multiple synchronized computers connected to the net, and Feldway is a computer itself disconnected from the net, with only the data transferred from the terminals.


That seems to be the correct understanding. In other words, even a 'space-time continuous attack' won't reach the main body, and it's an extremely troublesome opponent.


I see, it's a lot of trouble.

So you're saying that you have to go to the place where the mainframe is to defeat Feldway? It's certainly troublesome, but ......, huh?　If the mainframe is going to go out of its way to help us, isn't that convenient for us?"

Rather than searching for a guy who could be anywhere, I thought that if he would come, it would save me a lot of trouble. That's what I thought, but it seems that it's not that simple.

Diablo replies.

"Yes. But he is simply strong. If it's the main body's fighting ability, it may even surpass Guy. That's why I foolishly thought it was necessary to prepare for such an eventuality."

He said that the body given to him by Verdunava is a treasure for Feldway. That's why Feldway is always inhabiting his temporary body to avoid damaging it, but he has to consider the possibility of overturning that belief.

Well, that's true, I guess.

It is a situation that should not be allowed to be turned upside down by a single thought of the opponent. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I think it's a good idea.

The real Gee is evenly matched with Velzard. I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.

"Kuh-uh-uh, it will."

Diablo said that the Feldways of old were generally bad. In the past, he was a bit of a liability compared to the likes of Zeranus, the King of the Mushroom Demons, and Ivalaje, the Dragon of Extinction, but this was not the case.

Even the existence value measured in the labyrinth is not accurate if it was not the main body. This means that Feldway's true power is unknown. ......

I'll leave you to it. You're okay with that, right?"

I'm going to leave Feldway in Diablo's hands. I was surprised to hear that his true strength is dragon class, but I'm sure Diablo can take care of him... or is that too much to ask?

But as soon as Diablo heard my words, he said with a big smile on his face.

"I am thrilled, Mr. Rimuru. I will continue to strive to live up to your trust!"

Oh, it looks okay, here.

Diablo has a tendency to be overconfident, but he doesn't take on things he can't do. He may or may not be able to win, but he seems to think he can handle Feldway.

Then it would be foolish of me to worry about it.

If you're going to have to fight someone for a thousand days, it's a good idea to put your trust in your subordinate. So, I decided to have Diablo do his best, as I had originally planned.


Now that I understood how bad Feldway was, I was curious about the next target.

What moves do you think?"

"Hmm, yes, ...... is difficult to predict, but based on Feldway's personality, it seems likely that he will go after Masayuki-dono.

What?

The unexpected answer took me by surprise.

But it was certainly an opinion that could not be ignored.

He wondered what the point was of targeting Masayuki, but then he thought back to the possibility.

Why was Masayuki targeted in the first place?

Maybe, but I think he suspected that she was the reincarnation of Rudra and planned to eliminate her. And that was proven by the fact that Verglind loves Masayuki.

Feldway is probably more wary of Rudra than he is of Masayuki. The reason for this is unclear, but it certainly wouldn't be surprising if Masayuki was the target.

In the first place, I don't think it matters why. I don't mean to be persistent, but Feldway is hard-headed and won't admit to his own failures. He's not the kind of guy to give up just because he failed once.

Good grief, Diablo said.

That makes even more sense.

If that's the case, the next meeting might be dangerous. Verglind-san is here to escort us, so I think we'll be fine unless something goes wrong, but you should be on the lookout too."

"Don't worry, sir. We are always prepared for anything."

I can trust Diablo to do that.

Regardless of his personality, he is excellent in terms of his work. At the moment, his opponent, Xion, is also on a business trip, so he doesn't need to worry about anything else.

Diablo and I were having a careful meeting, trying to figure out what we were worried about, when we received a shocking piece of news.

"Oh, my God, Rimuru!

The call came from Mirim, full of hints of trouble.

"What's wrong?"

"Actually, Obera has escaped."

"Huh?"

"He said you betrayed Feldway and got into a battle with Mikael.

This is not the kind of thing that can be talked about through "thought transference" via the Demon Lord's ring. That's what I decided, and I decided to go to Mirim.






*






Mirim's castle is under construction, but some habitable parts have already been completed.

There was a medical facility in one of those corners, and Obera was lying in one of the rooms. When she had first escaped here, she had been in such a critical condition that she had fallen into unconsciousness, but now she was awake and her upper body was upright on the bed.

He said he had been asleep for a long time and had not been able to find out what happened.

Nodding my head yes, I greeted Obera.

"Hi, I'm Rimuru-Tempest. I'm the Demon Lord."

Since it was our first meeting, I started by introducing myself.

The one who looks at me with dismay is Frey, who seems to have grown more bewitching.

I'm not sure what to make of this, but I think it's a good idea to have a little more dignity.　The difference between being able to do something when the situation calls for it and being able to exude it in your everyday life is obvious to anyone who sees you.

I immediately received a bitter comment, but from Frey's point of view, I guess he was worried about the negative impact on Mirim.

Even Rimuru...and Milim is always making excuses for him at every turn.

That's the thing.

She reacted like a mother worried about her relationship with a bad friend.

I couldn't help but smile because it was kind of funny.

Seeing me like that, Carrion smirks at me.

Hey, it's not easy having Frey on your radar.

How dare you say that just when you've gained a friend.

Both Carrion and Mr. Frey, while they say a lot of things with their mouths, are very easy to talk to when they are out of sight of others. I asked them to do so, and I was grateful for it because it saved me from having to be so formal.

Even so, the atmosphere of the two of them had changed greatly. I had received reports from Benimaru, but now that I saw them in person, they seemed to be different people than before.

I heard you've taken full ownership of the power you've awakened.

Oh, hey. Tell Benimaru I appreciate what he did for me the other day."

Carrion is good friends with Benimar. He liked Benimaru when they first met, and they've been close ever since.

The fact that he didn't seem to mind at all proved the size of Carrion's capacity, as he boldly stated that he would soon catch up and overtake him, even though the power relationship was now reversed.

And Mr. Frey, too.

I'm grateful to you for that. Now I can be of more use to Mirim than before."

He smiled and expressed his gratitude, but that didn't mean that it was easier to scold Mirim, did it?

I doubted that, but needless to say, I needed the power to survive the Great War, so I took the thanks in stride.

I've been with you as a Demon Lord for a long time, but I never knew you had such a use for it. I didn't know there was such a use for it, even though I've been with you as a Demon Lord for a long time.

That's right. I thought he was just Gee's favorite, but I'm surprised the little bastard had that kind of power hidden away."

"I'm sure they weren't hiding it. It's just that no one noticed."

I knew it!

It doesn't matter what you know, if you can't handle it. That labyrinth made me understand that. So, Milim. Don't be a sore loser."

Milim, the know-it-all, is being rebuked by Mr. Frey.

Carrion laughed at that and expressed his thoughts.

But it's no laughing matter with Mirim. We look like idiots, too. But I'm convinced, you know?　When it comes to treating others well, no one can match Rimuru."

"Yes, you're right. If that's what you mean, we're the ones being used.

Even Frey nodded, but I hadn't expected that about the labyrinth of Ramiris either.

I thought I'd take advantage of it anyway, so I asked what it could do, and then I said, "What?　Is that really possible? I was surprised.

And it was actually through trial and error that the current labyrinth was born.

That was not what we had in mind from the beginning, so that opinion is an overestimation.

But well, if you look at the results, labyrinths are really great.

The fact that you can die in the labyrinth and be resurrected is a foul no matter what you think. It's perfect for real-world training, and from a defense standpoint, it's too impregnable.

It's a wonder that Ramiris was underestimated, and my accomplishments are like nothing.

However, it felt wrong to mention it, so I smiled and covered it up.

Now that the greetings are over, let's get down to business.

The atmosphere in the hospital room changed to a serious one when Mr. Frey said.

Obera, whose eyes had been black and white as he watched our exchange, tightened his expression at this point.

Finally, he turned to me and said a few words of greeting.

"Nice to meet you, Demon Lord Rimuru. I'm Obera, formerly known as the Three Demon Generals, and I was in charge of dealing with the Phantom Beast Tribe.

Obera cut him off.

He spoke with a mysterious look on his face, but he didn't give off the vibe of lying. Just as Mirim and the others believed him, my intuition told me that he was telling the truth.

But just in case, I decided to take a plunge.

Just for the record, you do understand that betrayal in the face of this war will raise suspicion of espionage, right?

"Of course. I have no way of proving my innocence, but I will tell you everything I know."

The expression on Obera's face was sincere, without even a hint of cloudiness. He explained what had happened, even though he wasn't at his best yet.

After the discussion with Mirim, I returned to Feldway and the others. It's good that he got a physical body there, but at the same time, he seems to have acquired angelic powers.

When Obera intuited that he was in trouble, he considered the possibility that he might be controlled by that authority. He then discarded the ultimate ability he had acquired, the "King of Salvation," before Feldway could force him to rule.

Sylvia-san taught me the art of separating the heart core from the authority. I was impressed that she knew so much, but thinking about it, I wondered if her treachery had been exposed because she sensed that Obera had abandoned his authority.

As a result, Sylvia, Cagalli and the others may have had a hard time, but it may not be right to put the blame on Obera.

I dismissed the matter as unavoidable and pretended not to have noticed it.

What is more important is the authenticity of Obera's story.

Frankly, I found it trustworthy.


I agree. It was well organized, and even told information that should have been kept hidden. If I'm going to go this far, it's not worth the price of espionage.


I know, right?

He blabbered on about the attack by Michael and his authority.

There was a lot of information that I couldn't believe was false, such as the fact that Michael's "Royal Citadel" had not been activated, that he was using the powers of Vergrind and Velzard as a matter of course, and that his power had destroyed Obera's army.

It's interesting to examine information from the perspective of whether or not it would be beneficial if it were false. That's why I always searched for opposing opinions on the Internet to see if there was more information for or against, and what the source was.

This method of identification was also effective against Obera.

If Obera was deceiving us, he would be solidifying Michael's authority with lies, but this information was too true. This information was too good to be true, and Ciel's verification results also determined it to be true.

What's more, Obera has agreed to accept my "analytical appraisal". If I do this, I can almost certainly confirm whether or not I have the right to do so.

The result is also white.

It was determined that Obera did not have the "King of Salvation" and was not ruled by Michael.

After all this, it was only right to trust Obera.

I asked Obera to give her some recovery medicine and honey to help her recover quickly.






*






Obera was left in the hands of Milim and his team.

The information I got from Obera was shared with the Demon Lord group.

It was no longer a time to be afraid of information leakage. We all agreed that it was too late to explain after something had happened to someone.

Two days passed in such a hurry, and then the day of the World Conference arrived.

Benimaru is staying home.

As Commander-in-Chief, I've entrusted you with the protection of the Demon Federation.

As my bodyguard, I had Ranga and Souei lurking in the shadows, and Diablo as my secretary. With this group of people, even if Feldway attacked here, they could handle it.

"Hey, mister!　I don't think there's much I can do for you today, but if you need anything, let me know.

I was greeted by a parrot.

Mewlan seemed to be at home, and was nowhere to be seen. Instead, Gadra was there as a guard for the parrot.

I returned his greeting lightly and promised to meet up with him later.

Once today's performance is over, there will be a standing party. After that, we're planning to go to the royal capital of Ingrassia for a leisurely drink with only those we know well.

A little excited, I headed for the assembly hall and met up with Masayuki at the square in front.

Since Masayuki was the star of the day, I, as an acquaintance and mediator, welcomed him.

"Hey, did I grow taller?"

I had grown a little taller when I became a dragon seed. My eye level with Masayuki had also become closer, but now it was back to the same height as before.

Do you see?　I think I've actually grown up a bit."

Masayuki smiled happily.

When I looked closer, I saw that her hair was also a dazzling blonde.

And your hair?

"Yes, it's completely discolored. I'm used to it by now, but it was a bit disconcerting at first."

There must be some kind of anomaly that's going on here.

I thought I was overreacting, but maybe I wasn't wrong about Rudra coming back.

But then again, Masayuki is Masayuki.

I didn't mind, and we entered the chamber together.


At the circular convention hall, where I had been several times before, the heavyweights from various countries had already arrived.

The place was noisy and bustling in its own way, but as soon as they saw us, it all went quiet.

All eyes are on us, but we're used to it by now.

It seemed to be the same for Masayuki, and he didn't seem to be nervous.

You've got a lot of class.

That's right, of course. When I was enthroned in the empire, there were so many people that they filled the entire space below me.

It is said that he made a proclamation of his accession to the throne from the balcony of the castle to his subjects, and this experience seems to have helped him grow strong.

It was lovely, Masayuki.

And Ms. Verglind also recalls with a woozy expression on her face. She had come as Masayuki's chaperone, but she had a great presence of her own.

Not to mention her good looks, her military uniform suits her well. It must have been Ms. Verglind who had captured the majority of the attendees' attention.

In the midst of all this attention, Chancellor Lester, with his bushy white beard, came running up to us and led me and Masayuki to our seats.

As befits a leading man, he was in the front row.

I sat down in my seat, exactly facing Masayuki.

Testarossa can be seen in the moderator's seat.

The arrangements are in place, and the historic reconciliation between the Western powers and the Eastern Empire will go off without a hitch, as long as no one gets in the way.

When you think about it, it's something that flags.

This time, that law would come into effect again, but I didn't notice it now, and just waited quietly for the meeting to start. ......






◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇






The Kingdom of Ingrassia, the Great Underground Maze.

It is a hidden passage that has been dug over hundreds of years. It is a facility that was prepared in case of angelic attacks, and is widely known as a maze because of its complexity.

There were also several large open areas in the hierarchy near the surface that could be used by anyone as a place of refuge in case of emergency.

But that was only the surface. Further down the hierarchy, there was a secret place that only a limited number of people knew about.

It is the dark side of King's Landing, an evil research facility that should not be allowed to be known to the world.

The Magical Inquisitors were in charge of the research there, and their research was on how to incorporate demon factors into the human body.

With muscle strength ten times greater than that of a normal person, skin tougher than steel, and a skeleton to support it, they were still producing results in their own right. The result was their own bodies, but the king's judgment was that it was not enough to face the supernatural existence of the Demon King.

"Another failure. This one's a little more fragile than I thought."

"Khihihihihi. The Empire has developed a weapon called a synthetic beast. I heard that the Empire had developed a weapon called the Synthetic Beast, and the concept is similar to our own.

"Hmm. There's a difference between modifying the human body directly and using it as a synthetic beast.

The existence of a dosage that induces a special dosage ability was a closely guarded secret. Therefore, the researchers here believed that the synthetic beast was the perfect weapon.

However, they believe that directly strengthening the human body is quicker than using synthetic beasts, and that they are superior to them. That's why, without any sense of avoidance, they are repeating experiments that would seem forbidden to ordinary people.

Still, it's not enough.

I can't get satisfactory results.

Currently, the factors of the demons that can be captured have been thoroughly investigated, and to some extent the factors have been successfully extracted. The rate of reinforcement is increasing and the version is being upgraded, but this time, the vulnerability of the mental side, not the physical side, has been exposed.

They say that a sound mind resides in a sound body.

If so, a strong body should be accompanied by a strong mind.

So the researchers began to search for a way to merge with spiritual life forms.

It was argued that the quickest way to do so would be to take in the power of the demon. The reason for this was that it was easier to obtain a prime body.

In the north, there were repeated skirmishes with the demon tribe, and lower and higher level demons were being procured by the rough trade of capturing the weaker ones.

Such a demon tribe had been inhabiting the corpse and had incarnated. Thanks to this, we had succeeded in analyzing the composition of the ingredients and had found some interesting results.

What is the mechanism of incarnation with the demon tribe?

The answer to this question was that the magical element had invaded the human cells and remade them to be more comfortable with magic.

However, this is only when the demon side takes the initiative, and even if you try to forcibly take in demon power, it will only be poison to the human body.

Of course.

Energy intake through food, sleep, and even breathing would become unnecessary, and even life would cease. It would be like being reborn as a completely different life form, and to control it by human will would be the ultimate in recklessness.

Besides, the Magical Inquisitors had been mistaken.

What was important was the power of the will, but he was only focusing on strengthening the body.

It was a misguided theory that only the physical body should be trained since the mental side was strengthened by the demon's power, and the experiments were repeated in the wrong direction.

And one more thing.

Our misunderstanding is fatal.

By cultivating the cells incarnated by the demon, a factor can be extracted. He believed that by injecting it, the subject would also possess the power of the demon.

This was a big mistake.

The demon uses the power of will to take the incarnated body as its own. No change can come from a cell without will, but only poison that will consume the subject.

In other words, a torturous experiment that could not possibly succeed was being repeated.

For the subject, this environment is hell itself.

That is why it is not the best people who are chosen, but orphans, slaves, etc., who no one would fuss about disposing of.

And he's a criminal.

Those who had committed serious crimes were secretly executed and brought to this laboratory...


Reiner was repeatedly breathing hard, coherently.

Despair and fear occupied my mind.

From the honorable position of Commander of the Knights of the Kingdom of Ingrassia, he had now fallen into the status of a disposable experiment.

A number of his men who adored Reiner were killed.

At first, I resented the unreasonableness of it, but I soon lost heart.

Because the help he thought would come never came.

Reiner's family home was demolished and he was abandoned by the Order.

Of course.

Reiner's outrageous actions at the previously held council meeting.

Using Elric, the first prince of the Kingdom of Ingrassia, as a portable shrine, he fought against the Demon King Rimuru and the Holy Knight Commander Hinata.

He would have been a hero if he had won, but he lost so easily.

This would have been a serious offense to the outside world, and Reiner was charged with treason.

Naturally, all of Reiner's associates were charged with death. In other words, they were being used as experimental materials here in the laboratory.

The help that Reiner had hoped for was never going to come.

Reiner understood this, and now spent his days dreading when he would be used as an experimental subject.

（Oh, shit!　Why, why is this happening?)

I barely haven't gone insane because my anger recurs from time to time as I remember. It was a complete backhanded grudge against the Demon Lord Rimuru and against the Holy Knight Commander Hinata.

（I'll make you cry!　I will not allow you to beg for your life. I'll make you accept me, and then I'll torture you to death!)

An intense hatred held Reiner's mind together.

Besides, there was another reason why Reiner was the way he was.

This was because, at the moment, Reiner was only undergoing physical enhancement surgery.

After strengthening them as much as possible, they were ready to move on to the fusion experiments with the demons. Especially since Ryner was an A-rank or higher in his prime, the researchers were treating him with care.

I doubt that it could be called good luck, but at any rate, Reiner was still alive and well, and if you look at his strength alone, he had reached the extra-A level.

And the day.

The hope that was never meant to come was revealed to Rainer.






*






I didn't realize how easy it was to break in."

It was Feldway, who had half-heartedly entrusted Vega with guiding the way, who praised Vega for saying so.

There are four of us in this room.

Vega led the way, followed by Alios and Mai, with Feldway at the tail end.

After that strategy meeting, we each made our own preparations.

They all agreed that the attack would not start at the same time, but would focus the attention of the Demon Lords on the first point and then hit the main target.

If that happened, Feldway and the others who were aiming for Masayuki would be one step behind.

The first attack will be made by "General Samsung" Feng.

The task is to attract the attention of the demon lords with a flamboyant rampage.

He defeated Daguerre, one of the Eight Star Demon Lords, and took control of his army. The impact of his defeat was tremendous, and it was sure to chill the hearts of the Demon Lords.

We have also assigned the "Three-Star General" Jahil to assist Feng. With this, we have assembled enough forces to bring down the west.

And the real deal is Feldway and his team.

The goal was to get into the world conference to be held in the royal capital of Ingrassia and get rid of Masayuki.

In order to prevent this from being interrupted, the "Three Star General" Zalario was put on standby in the sky to prevent the Demon Lord Luminous from making any moves. Or, at Feldway's signal, he was going to launch an all-out attack on the royal capital of Ingrassia.

And...

At the same time as Fen's attack begins, the army of Zelanus, the "King of Mushrooms and Demons," is scheduled to attack the stronghold of the Demon Lord Mirim in the former Eurasia.

Currently, there are six remaining "eight stars": Guy, Rimuru, Ramiris, Mirim, Daguerre, and Luminous. Since he was going to attack two of them at the same time, he hoped that it would upset the other Demon Lords.

However, the Demon Lord Rimuru, who was as much a target to watch out for as Gee, was reported to be near Masayuki, whom Feldway and the others were targeting. His name was on the list of participants for the meeting scheduled to be held today, but the possibility that this was a trap could not be denied.

That's why Feldway was thinking of acting cautiously and flexibly.

For this reason, he did not try to break into the capital by force, but accepted Vega's advice and used a hidden passage.

This was a hit.

One of the exits to the passage was located in the forest on the outskirts of the royal capital of Ingrassia. By entering from there, it was very easy to get in without being affected by the "warding" that protects the royal capital.

And that wasn't all.

"Hmm, I didn't know this lab was still alive. It brings back memories. I remember when they experimented on me here, too."

Vega muttered something like that, and sure enough, just as he had said, there was a sign of people at the end of that passage.

From Feldway's point of view, they are small, insignificant in power, but by human standards, they meet a certain level of strength.

At first I thought it would be troublesome to create a ruckus here, but I soon realized that this was an unexpected blessing.

"Yes, I knew it. The people trapped in these cages are experimental subjects for the research we're doing here."

As he explained this, Vega approached the cage unprotected. He then spoke in a friendly manner to the person in the cage.

"Hey, bro. How you doing?"

The person who spoke to him was Reiner, whose mind was on the verge of breaking.

"What ...... are you ...... not those fucking researchers ......?"

Reiner noticed someone standing in front of the cage and cowered in fear. But he was confused by the unusual appearance and looked up to find Vega.

Vega laughs.

By the looks of it, you're pretty fucked up.

You're ......?"

"Hey, I'm Vega. I'm Vega, your senior, if you will."

"Senior ......?"

Oh, yeah. I've been used as an experimental subject in this place. I was lucky to escape, but I still have nightmares about it.

Hearing this, Rainer became familiar with Vega.

As people who knew this harsh environment, we developed a sense of camaraderie.

You're just like me. ......

"Oh, yes, of course. So, the thing is, can I help you?"

Vega proceeds on his own.

Feldway, who was listening to this, did not interrupt.

The mission had been entrusted to Vega, and so far things had gone well. He thought it would be a good idea to leave it to her, and he would keep an eye on it.

Besides, there's another thought.

There were many other prisoners here, not only Rainer, but also many others who were called experimental subjects.

There were nearly a hundred of them. Their bodies were similarly strengthened, and they seemed to be in good shape.

Yes, he was wondering if he could use these experimental subjects as a substitute for the demons that had not yet incarnated.

While Feldway ponders, Vega and Rainer continue their negotiations.

"What?"

Reiner was puzzled by the story that had come to him.

If you're going to help me, I can't say no.

But Vega and the others were too suspicious. I wondered if I could really trust them, but it was only for a moment.

After all, if he refused the offer, the only thing that awaited him would be ruin. I would go insane in fear and despair and die in the not-too-distant future.

It would be better if you could pass away without suffering. ...... Thinking about it, it was many times better to be cheated here.

"Help me. If you ask me to swear allegiance, I swear I'll give you everything I have!　So get me out of here!"

Reiner exclaimed.

Hearing this, Vega grinned and put his hand on the steel cage. Strengthened by magic, it was twisted and torn asunder by Vega's power.

The sheer force of his strength reminded Rainer of the difference in rank.

But what surprised me more was the number of corpses of the Magical Inquisitors lying at my feet. They had been quietly and swiftly disposed of by Arios.

It had been bothering him that the patrol was slow in coming, but Reiner paled when he learned the cause of the delay.

(I never thought that the secret forces of the Kingdom of Ingrassia, which even I can't stand, would be killed so easily. It's hard to believe, but these guys are truly monsters!)

Even as I thought this, I felt a sincere sense of relief.

I knew that I had made the right choice, and that's what Rainer thought.

Nice to meet you, brother. So, if there's anyone else you want to help, let me know. I'll get you all out."

Reiner's face was stained with joy at this unexpected offer.

"Oh, my God!　All of them. They're all my men!"

Only those who were deemed to be able to withstand the enhancements were gathered here. Women and children had been sent to other experiments and were already dead. Reiner and the others who were being held here had been told this as part of their punishment. So, without hesitation, they chose to follow Vega.

All right, from now on, you're under my command. "Okay, from now on, you're under my command, and we're going to run wild in the capital up here. Even if you don't want to, you'll have to follow me.

"Of course. It's an order I'd rather have. We have a grudge against this country, too."

Reiner responded to Vega's words with a happy smile. The knights who had been Reiner's subordinates also nodded with the same feeling of regret for their dead comrades and families.

The fact that their lives had been spared only added to their resentment at being subjected to such a horrific experiment. Now, their anger would not subside.

And what's more, this is where Feldway gives a boost.

"Then I will give you the power to do the same. Are you ready, Mai?"

"Yes. I have been entrusted with a hundred warriors by Master Jahir."

In accordance with Feldway's wishes, Mai had already taken action. In this short period of time, she had performed an "instantaneous transfer" and had taken care of a selection of warriors from Jahir.

Jahir was unhappy, but it was an imperial order from Feldway. There was no way he could disobey it, and the order was promptly carried out.

And so, deep underground in the Kingdom of Ingrassia.

The incarnation ceremony for the liners took place.

The one with the stronger will takes control of the body. In some cases, the ego can be integrated, but Reiner and his team accepted that it was much better than outrageous human experimentation.

And so...

I'm full of energy. Thank you, Lord Vega, for saving us and giving us a chance to avenge you."

It's okay. I'll lend you this one, and you can go freak out!"

Reiner took the weapon from Vega.

It's a knight's sword embodied in the Buzou no Ou that Vega stole from Orlia. In the event that you have any questions regarding where and the best way to get in touch with us, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Rainer's current power, in terms of existence value, exceeds one million. By adding the mythical class to it, it had been strengthened to the equivalent of two million.

Reiner's subordinates had also been transformed from 200,000 to the equivalent of 500,000, a level of strength equivalent to special A or higher.

Vega was in a good mood, having acquired an unexpected asset.

Feldway was also pleased with the results.

(This was an unexpected find, wasn't it? (This was an unexpected find.) (Do your best to make yourself useful to me.)

With a smile on his face, he watched Rainer and the others leave in high spirits.






◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇






A large tremor hit the "Tentongkaku".

On that day, Damargania, the "Holy Void," was on the verge of destruction.

"Oh, that looks pretty bad. Maybe it's the guy who ravaged the earth a long time ago?"

Hearing Ultima's murmur, Veyron and Zonda, who had been called back, tensed.

I will check with Master Daguerre immediately."

"That's right. We have to consider the worst case scenario, so Zonda, run to where you can contact Beretta right now, and make sure to report back to Zion-san.

As soon as they heard Ultima's order, Veyron and Zonda moved.

If this place fell, it was obvious that Rubellios, where Xion was staying, would be the next target. It was obvious that if this place fell, the next target would be Rubellios, where Sion was located. Of course, it was safe to contact the headquarters and inform Sion of the seriousness of the situation.

Perhaps because she understood this, there was no objection from Zonda at all.

The reason why he didn't say why or why I would fight with him, or any other unnecessary things, was because of his absolute trust and fear of Ultima.

Unlike the lower-ranking demons, those under Ultima's direct control understand the character of their Lord. They understand the character of their Lord.

Ultima has no mercy for those who disobey her, and she has no mercy for those who disobey her.

And above all, Ultima's judgment was accurate.

When Zonda tried, she found that the magic had already been blocked in this area. All means of communication had been blocked, and they could no longer communicate their situation.

Of course, we are fully prepared for such an eventuality.

This was an issue that had been raised as a reminder of the previous attack on Leon, so Limuru had instructed us to keep in constant contact. He told us to communicate with each other on a regular basis, once every five minutes.

This way, any point where contact is lost is considered to be abnormal. So, even if we didn't panic, we could tell within five minutes that something was wrong, but Ultima must have decided that it was too late.

If that was the case, all Zonda could do was follow orders to the best of her ability. Zonda was not so incompetent as to waste her precious time.

Zonda passes the gale and disappears.

Ultima stood up and bit her nails.

If I'm right about this, should I consider running away?"

Ultima didn't want to do that, but she was determined to do it if the worst happened.

(Limuru-sama also believed in Daguerre. At the same time, he also had his doubts. ......)

Limuru appears to be a good-natured person, and indeed, he is usually gullible to the point of being out of touch, but in fact, he is very cunning.

Ultima, the king of demons, respected his calculating nature.

Then Limuru casually muttered some words.

"Even after explaining the enemy's purpose, asking for support from Verdra is a bit curious.

At the banquet of the demon kings, Daguerre always seemed to want Verdra to come and support him.

Mikhail wanted the Verdra factor. He should have heard it and understood it, but he still wanted Verdra instead of Ultima.

I could understand that it was because they knew each other, but it still bothered him.

Ultima doesn't think that Rimuru is overthinking things.

After hearing Limuru's story, he had finished every thought he had about Daguerre. As a result, he had come to the same conclusion as Limuru that there was no possibility that Daguerre had betrayed him.

(To begin with, Daguerre was born from the Mad King of the Giant Race, right?　(To begin with, Dagrule was born from a mad king of the Titan race, right? He rampaged with such ferocity that he destroyed the world, and was sealed up by Lord Veldanava. ......)

He didn't know all the details of it, but he could guess.

In the first place, this place was adjacent to Ultima's dominion. Naturally, he already had information about Daguerre, and Ultima knew more about Daguerre than anyone else.

Limuru must have sent Ultima in anticipation of this.

(I get excited when I think that people are expecting me, don't you?)

Ultima thought so, and after arriving in Damargania, she continued to look around and investigate Daguerre to see if he had betrayed her.

And find a clue.

Daguerre had been told that he had three brothers, but he had only been introduced to one brother.

I thought that the one remaining person was the key, but here it was, an attack of a powerful presence.

His presence resembled that of Daguerre and his brother, Glassord...

"The Mad King of the Titans."

Ultima muttered, and smiled wryly.






*






When Veyron entered the throne room, there was a lot of shouting going on.

That's understandable.

"The divine structure called Tentongkaku has revived its function. In other words, the door to the heavens had been opened.

Originally, the "Tentongkaku" was a divine fortress that protected us from any enemy. This time, however, the "Tentongkaku" had become the battlefield.

It was inevitable that the people living here would be very upset.

Moreover, the presence coming down from there was very familiar to the old giants, so it was very difficult.

Even before they could see the enemy, the Titans were disturbed.

Although they are called "Titans," their lifespan and abilities vary greatly from individual to individual.

First of all, there is no lifespan for an old individual. They may be replaced by their successors, passing on their memories and powers, but this is only a measure in case they die in battle.

Spare and replacement individuals have a lifespan, but it also gets longer with each passing generation, and even the most recent generation had a lifespan of several hundred years.

And as for its abilities, the old one had powers worthy of being called a god.

The giants are huge, ranging from two to two and a half meters in size even in their normal state, but when they are in battle, they become several times larger. The strength of their bodies is the essence of the giant race.

The difference between normal and battle conditions is more than ten times that of the oldest individual, Daguerre. In other words, it would grow to a size of over 20 meters.

There was someone in the giant tribe who was as strong as or even stronger than Daguerre. That was his younger brother, Feng.

Daguerre had three brothers, but his youngest brother was a tyrant who had lost control of his emotions while maintaining his intellect and reason.

It was sealed by the Veldanavas, and ever since then, Dagrual has been protecting that seal. That was why he had not been able to move from this place, even though his territory had turned into a desert.

Feng was sealed in the Palace of Heavenly Star. And the only way to get there is through the Tentong Pavilion.

There were other ways, but they were privileges reserved for those who possessed the key.

By the way, there is only one owner of the "key".

Verdunava's sister, Verzad, was the only one allowed to open the gate to the Palace of Heavenly Stars.

Daguerre knew this, so this situation was not unexpected.

.........

......

...

Daguerre glared at the lower levels from the upper floors of the Tentongkaku.

He remembered the party of the demon kings the other day.

The self-indulgent Demon Lords were asserting themselves while being considerate of the other party's position. They seemed to have no sense of cooperation, yet their opinions were strangely united in their discussions.

In accordance with what was stipulated there, the Demon Lord Rimuru's subordinates were busy adjusting the "transfer magic circle" until just the other day. Now that things have settled down, they are just in time for the final battle.

I was impressed with how well they worked, and their work was flawless. Daguerre was very pleased with his work, and he threw a big party to thank them for their hard work.

It was a bit lonely now that only Ultima and the others, our guests, remained.

The "transfer magic circle," which looked like art in some ways, shone brightly and sat in the center of the lower level. But it was its performance that was noteworthy.

It is said that the purpose of the magic circle is to be able to come and go in case of emergency, but in reality, they are definitely thinking about the distant future.

This time it was a makeshift one, but Daguerre thinks it's a fine enough product. If it can be used to move troops, it should also be used by a large number of merchants.

（Limuru, the Demon Lord. He's not to be underestimated. How dare he make such a complex magical device available to anyone by using the magical elements that fill the air. There may be a limit to the number of times you can use it, but it's just a matter of replenishing the magical element. It will be much safer to come and go than to cross that magical desert.)

In this abandoned and dying land, it is all we can do to import enough food to satisfy our people.

The giants don't live off of haze. They need to eat enough to keep up with their huge bodies, and the younger they are, the more energy they consume.

This was the proof that he was alive, but in a way, it was also a curse.

We export materials from the desert demons and depend on food supplies from other countries. To do this, young men and women became travelers, crossing the harsh desert again and again.

This was the reality of Damorgania, the "Holy Void.

However, with this "magic circle for transfer", we will be able to free ourselves from this hardship.

Until now, it was common knowledge that food and other items could not be "transferred". However, in the future, such problems would be solved.

(It's scary. I didn't expect to find a solution to my past woes so easily at ....... This way, I won't have to force myself on Rubellios.)

It was Daguerre who was terrified to see how far the demon king Rimuru could see.

He honestly thought that the demon king named Rimuru, who had ideas that he had never thought of before, was amazing. And I admire his deep recklessness, and I don't want to make an enemy of him.

However, someone appeared to interrupt Daguerre's excitement.

Suddenly, a voice echoed in my mind.

"My friend Daguerre, it's been a long time. I'm glad to hear that you are well. I wanted to get in touch with you as soon as I got back here, but things have been a bit hectic. I wanted to get in touch with you as soon as I got back, but a lot of things happened.

Daguerre didn't panic.

This situation was also expected.

"Hmm, Feldway. It's nice of you to call me friend, but you and I are enemies now. I don't want to talk long, so tell me what you want.

The owner of the voice, Feldway, seemed to be sniffling when he heard the reply.

'It's too bad you're so cold. I was hoping to ask you to help me as well?"

Daguerre's reaction to Feldway's insinuations was even more chilling.

"The return of Verdunava?　I'm not interested. I have no hard feelings about the Fen being sealed, and I am indebted to him for giving us this land and taking care of us, but that doesn't mean I'm going to help resurrect him, does it?

In the first place, Feldway and Daguerre were not that close friends.

In fact, from Daguerre's point of view, he was even angry with Feldway when he heard that Mikael had mental control over Dino, his true friend.

When I heard that Dino had betrayed me, I wondered what kind of madman I was...

(There's no way that idiot would voluntarily choose such a troublesome act of betrayal in the first place.)

I was deeply convinced of this when I heard the story.

So Daguerre rejected Feldway's offer out of hand.

Feldway was not amused by this.

I'm not sure what to make of this.

He tries to stir up Daguerre's temper to get the better of the negotiations.

The three brothers Dagrule and the other three brothers were vicious giant gods who challenged the "Star Dragon" Verdanava and were sealed away. That was Daguerre and his three brothers.

The king of tyranny, spreading destruction across the earth.

Its tremendous super destructive power has turned several lands into scorched earth.

Daguerre and the others had been called the worst gods of destruction, but they had been quiet since they revered Verdunava.

While living quietly in the territory he was given, he guarded the "Tentongkaku" as part of his duties.

But that doesn't mean that they've become docile.

Even now that Vedanava has blocked his power, his rage is still called the "wrath of the earth.

It would be an easy provocation, Feldway thought.

But.

"I'm sorry. It's not the same now. I have more hope for the future now than ever before. I can't betray him, considering that I owe it all to Rimuru.

And then, I was rejected very easily.

And as if further negotiations were pointless, Daguerre said, "Let's meet on the battlefield next time," and unilaterally ended the "reminder.

.........

......

...

I'm stuck..., Daguerre muttered.

"Feldway, I didn't expect you to break the seal on Feng. Is this some kind of revenge for my refusal to help you?"

"Brother, don't be alarmed. Don't worry, brother. Sooner or later, this was inevitable, I suppose."

Veyron shows his displeasure at the sight of the brothers, who are poised at ease.

"Well, well, that's not a very nice thing to say. Has Master Daguerre been in contact with the enemy?"

It was an order from the Lord Ultima. Veyron pursued, determined not to allow any excuses.

However, this ended up being a disappointment.

From the beginning, Daguerre had no intention of hiding anything.

"Well, don't be so hard on yourself. I admit that you are a powerful man, but you are weaker than I am."

Daguerre answered without panic.

In response, his younger brother, Glassord, followed suit.

"Calm down, Lord Vayron. It's true that my brother received an invitation from Feldway. But he turned it down, and that's why we're in this situation now."

When admonished, Veyron nodded, "Hmm.

I just raised my voice and questioned him, but he had already guessed it.

The attitudes of Daguerre and the others showed no sign of lying, and I decided that they were probably telling the truth.

Then why did he say something that would benefit the enemy during Walpurgis?

"Our great king has been concerned that there are many questions about Master Daguerre's actions. Give me a clear explanation of it."

And that's when Veyron was about to ask the question.

"Well, I figured it out. The old man wanted to ask for help from Rimuru-sama, didn't he?　At the banquet of the Demon Lords, you wanted to show that you were related to the enemy by saying something that would arouse suspicion, didn't you?

Ultima, who had arrived late, asked Daguerre.

Or rather, it was a determination, not a question.

When Daguerre heard this, he laughed mirthfully.

Excellent!　You are indeed my nemesis. I'm glad you're here and not Carrera after all!"

This was Daguerre's true intention.

Carrera is too cerebral to be able to read the back of the book.

If he had misunderstood that Daguerre had betrayed him, it would have been very difficult for him to undo it.

In this respect, Ultima is a safe bet.

He was also a bitter enemy who had tormented him for a long time, so he trusted his brain.

With a big smile on his face, Daguerre told Ultima that she was right. By suggesting that he was related to Feldway, Daguerre had suggested that he himself and the Holy Void might be targeted.

Like Dino, he would not like to be betrayed in a way he did not intend. He decided that if there was a non-zero chance of that happening, he should tell her about it.

However, he thought it would only lead to misunderstandings if he told it as it was, so he only dared to hint at it.

"Hmm. I knew it, didn't I? Then I guess it's just like you wanted.　Because Rimuru-sama understood exactly what was going on. Rimuru-sama is a cunning and all-seeing person, so I think this situation is part of his calculations. So don't worry, I'm sure it will work out."

Ultima told him with a smile.

Daguerre nodded broadly and smiled with relief.

"You heard the man, Glassord. My colleague is a great guy. I knew that if he had the divine eye that made that Clayman look so good, he would have realized what I was trying to do!

Ultima and Daguerre had a heart-to-heart without Rimuru. It was probably a blessing for them that they didn't realize that the basis for this was a complete misunderstanding.

Anyway, a settlement was reached between the two parties.

"Well then, I guess I'll just have to work hard until Master Rimuru arrives."

"Ultima, I am at your command. I will see to it that your enemies are vanquished!

Ultima and Veyron believe in Rimuru and go into battle.

I know, I'm going to have a go at him. It's going to be a bit of a struggle against Feng, but I don't think I'm the only one who can stop him.

"I'll accompany you, brother."

The Daguerre brothers were also excited to see the spirit of Ultima and the others, even though they were supposed to be guests.

And so, promptly, they all began to move to intercept.






◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇






Mirim and the others were aware of the horizon beyond.

Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

While everyone's face paled in silence, it was Carrion who muttered this first.

The earth and sky were filled with swarms of bugs. Their ferocity was immeasurable, and the threat was unimaginable.

I'm not sure what to make of this. It's a shame that the Twelve Mushroom Generals, the belly of Zelanus, are all here. ......

It was a sickly Obera who responded to Carrion.

Thanks to the care of Mirim and the others, he was now fully recovered.

Obera is determined to avenge the death of Mikhail, who destroyed her beloved subordinate. But even she was at a loss for words when she was confronted with the horrible reality of a world crawling with horrible bugs.

Some say they simply don't like bugs.

Otherwise, he would not have asked Zarario to come forward to take charge of the more dangerous dragon of destruction.

Regardless of what was going on behind the scenes, now was not the time to be escaping reality.

Mirim said.

"Hey, Frey. I'm not sure what to do with it.

Hearing this, Frey pondered, "Yeah, .......

The idea wasn't a bad one.

Obviously, the fact that he was looking at Mirim with such expectant eyes made it seem like it was okay to allow it. If Frey was not a fan of bugs, he would have agreed without a second thought.

But Frey waited for him.

I had no particular reason to disagree, but I had a bad feeling about it.

"I suppose it's tactically possible to make the biggest attack on the first move. It's also a good idea to expose your opponent's capabilities before you even know what they're capable of."

Frey dismissed Mirim's idea, slurring his words.

With so many enemies, it would be tempting to have Mirim wipe them out. However, he decided that he should not underestimate the pollywogs.

The reason for this is that I know Zegion.

Frey fought Apito, the "Mushroom Queen," but he also observed the fight between Carrion and Zegion.

Apito, whom he had just barely beaten, was a fearsome demon, but Zegion seemed to be a being of a different level.

This time, the enemy was the same species as the Zegions.

Honestly, maybe I'm just overly concerned, but I don't think we should underestimate our enemies.

No one laughs at Frey for being soft when he talks like that.

On the contrary, Carrion agrees.

No, I agree with Frey. No, I agree with Frey. That kind of intuition is not to be taken lightly, and I myself feel that we should be cautious about what we do. I don't think Mirim has anything to worry about, but let's go at it head-on."

And even Midray.

The problem is that there are so many of them, but their individual strength is more like B rank. If we destroy the A-ranked bugs that seem to be the commanders, the rest will be a ragtag bunch. Since their strength is clear, it's easy to find a target. It may be a surprisingly easy victory.

I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

That's not really a strategy - Frey thought, but then he remembered that Midlai's men were used to that kind of recklessness and swallowed his words.

Then we'll take care of the flying ones, and leave the ground-crawling bugs to you, Midlai-dono.

It was Frey who summed up the story as if it didn't matter anymore.

"We can't just leave this to Midgley. I'll have my warrior corps take care of the commanders. I'll have my warrior corps take care of the commanders, and the headless limbs will make good training grounds for the newborn army.

It would be great if you could do that. I'm sorry to be the one to bring this up, but I don't think it's right for a priest to be on the front lines.

Carrion said that he just couldn't help it, and Midlai agreed with a chuckle.

Seeing such an exchange, Obera thought to himself.

It's not just a little different, it's fundamentally wrong.... Obera wisely didn't say what he thought of it, and just said, "I'll take care of Milim-sama's protection.

Finally, Mirim laughs and declares.

"Ha-ha-ha!　As my four heavenly kings, I expect you to do your best!"

As always, with joy.

Then again, the conversation would be like normal times, and the place would be relaxed.

"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

"Mirim, you're too influenced by Rimuru. Why don't you take a more normal position instead of being one of the Four Heavenly Kings?"

I don't want to!　I want the Four Heavenly Kings!　I've always thought it was unfair that only Rimuru had the Four Heavenly Kings!

Well, not for me, anyway.

"Me too. Do as you wish, Lord Milim, and I will obey.

"For me, it's actually my favorite. And I'm glad you've accepted it."

"......" What? It's like I'm the bad guy who's against it. Okay, that's enough.

And in the end, it was a series of promises, to the point where Frey broke.






*






In the face of the enemy from the other world, the Mirim forces also deployed and waited.

The total number of them had swollen to the largest scale in the "Eight Star Demon King" by swallowing three of the former Demon King's territories.

As Carrion and Frey have evolved into Super Awakeners, they have also been reorganized.

As general-in-chief, Carrion assumed the position of general and was given command of the entire army.

Frey, as Director of the Guard, is in charge of Milim's direct security.

As High Priestess, Midgley is in charge of the logistics of leading a group of warrior priests.

And Obera, who had recently joined the team, had become the military strategist and was in charge of planning operations.

These four are the four heavenly kings that Mirim is proud of.

The first one I'll introduce is the main team led by Carrion, the Knights of the Flying Beast.

The leader of the group was Sphere, and the vice leader was Phobio.

The former Beast King's Warrior Corps, as a thousand chiefs, led the remnants of Clayman's army, the warriors of the Beast Kingdom, and others. The warrior corps numbered one hundred, which alone made for an army of one hundred thousand.

Add to this Carrion's command, and you have a fearless army.

Next up was the Mirim Guard, a super-elite unit led directly by Frey.

Lucia and Claire act as second-in-command to support Frey as Secretary.

The knights of the sky driving the flying demon beasts that were Frey's tigers. There were over three thousand of them. The team was led by Frey's aide, the Tenshoushuu, and consisted of ten to thirty men each.

The Griffon is a B+ ranked magical beast, but after being trained by Carrion, its strength has been raised to the equivalent of A-rank. When ridden by the elite warriors of the Beast Kingdom and the "Queen of the Sky" SS from all over the world, its overall strength exceeds the A rank.

In addition, the Tenshoushuu had been affected by the Frey Awakening, so their individual strength was equivalent to the top of the A class. There were also a certain number of people who were comparable to the special A class, making them a considerable force to be reckoned with.

In this world, this is the largest army consisting of only those who are above A rank. Although they were only a little over 3,000 cavalrymen, they were fierce warriors who could easily handle aerial combat with high-speed maneuvers in unison.

Lastly, I would like to introduce the hastily assembled logistical support forces.

Although Midgley is represented, Hermes is actually in charge.

Stray demons, mercenaries from the human race, and former servants of Clayman. It was a mixed unit made up of a variety of people, but they had been entrusted to Midray to assist in the battle.

Most of them had been involved in construction work before, and their individual strength was D-rank to B-rank at best. Their temperament was not suited for fighting, and their duties were to carry supplies, procure food, and assist the Priestesses as medics.

However, there were many of them and they numbered in the hundreds of thousands.

This was the entirety of the Mirim force, totaling over 200,000.

It is a formation in which the combat troops are in the front, protecting the support troops.

In addition to this, there were reinforcements from the Demon Federation.

What stands out is the army led by Gerudo.

We had been summoned for the construction of the city of Mirim's residence, but we had to go straight into a defensive battle.

Not all of us, as we had to go to other departments for support, but a total of 35,000 people, including the yellow and orange corps, had gathered.

It is a force that specializes in defense, but the yellow corps is particularly impressive.

As the Geld evolved, the fighting ability of the boar people under its control also increased significantly, and the number of members increased to 10,000. Some of them had even reached A-rank, and on average, they had become a fearsome army equivalent to A-rank.

The Orange Legion had gained a lot of experience in battle and was now an army of veterans. They boasted an average rank of B, a level of strength unrivaled by any other knight order. In addition, when combined with Geld's authority, they would serve as a shield to protect their allies with ironclad defense.

This time he would not be on the front line, but would be in charge of protecting the rear.

And let's not forget the "Flying Dragons" led by Gavil.

There were only a hundred of them, but all of them were special A class, a ridiculous amount of strength.

I'm planning to be flexible and go as wild as I want.

Finally, Carrera and Esprit.

Even though there were only two of them, they were estimated to be a formidable force.

With the help of these reinforcements, they decided to fight against the army of Zelanus, the "King of Mushrooms and Demons", but it was still going to be a tough battle.

After all, the number of enemies was more than ten times greater than ours - more than three million.

As if gushing out of the ground, the wriggling bugs attacked.

And so, the war was about to begin...


First on the list is Carrera.

If Mirim won't do it, then I guess it's my turn.

With that, he happily stepped forward.

I'm not sure what to do with it. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.

Mirim won't stop either.

Before they knew it, these two had become best friends.

The damage to the surrounding area had not only doubled, but had become immeasurable due to the synergistic effect, but that was irrelevant to the two of them. As long as they could enjoy themselves, that was all that mattered, and they increased the power of each other.

Yes, power.

Power is strength!

Strength is a destructive force.

"Damn you bugs! You're all going to die!　"The ultimate and most powerful... 'Doomsday Collapse and Extinction Wave'!"

Carrera was a master at unleashing the most powerful magic from the very first move.

This led to the disappearance of over two million bugs.

The gap of more than ten times was now reduced to about four times. Seeing this, the faces of the soldiers who had been lamenting the hopeless gap in strength were filled with hope.

At first glance, Carrera's actions may have seemed reckless, but they were perfect for boosting the economy or morale. By reducing the enemy's numbers before they could cause any casualties, we were able to maintain our strength and increase our will to fight.

With this, it seemed that the war situation would quickly become favorable - but .......

Frey's bad premonition came true.

"No way!　He just channeled my magic into the other world. ......"

I don't believe in ...... the magic of Lady Carrera, but it seems to be true. This is why I hate bugs and hexenbiests. Some of them nullify magic, and they really are our natural enemies, aren't they?

Esprit was right.

Carrera's magic has been altered by a single bug-shaped magical beast that has altered the flow of power.

It is a female-formed magical beast with beautiful, slender, rainbow-colored wings.

His name was Period. He was one of the twelve policemen who had an absolute advantage over magic.

"Well, now is not the time to be impressed. I'm about to come. Mr. Geld, please ward the zenith with all your might.

"Yes, sir."

Carrera's smile faded and he motioned to Gerudo.

Gerald followed without questioning it back.

With this exchange at her side, Esprit was quickly making her move. She used her unique skill, "The Seer," to detect the situation and deployed her own defensive magic to reinforce the "defensive ward" that Geld had set up.

"What?"

And just when Frey was wondering, it opened.

A strange distortion occurred in the sky.

"Mm, you're right."

"You're the master, Mr. Carrera!　You're able to decipher that complicated magic rewrite in one shot."

"Of course, or rather, the basics. More importantly, can you stand it?"

I'm going to join you, then. If this castle is destroyed, Frey will be very angry!

As soon as he said that, Milim also held out his hand to the heavens.

Then, the triple protection of Geld's "warding", Esprit's defensive magic, and Mirim's protective curtain was activated simultaneously.

Immediately after that, a wave of destruction poured down from the rift in the heavens. It was indeed the "Doomsday Collapse and Extinction Wave" that Carrera had released.

"Hey, could this be..."

Hey, hey, that's what I'm talking about. ......

With his brain, Frey guessed what had happened.

And Carrion, with his instincts, is also aware of what is happening.

Midgley muttered, a step behind.

I'm not sure what to make of this. What a reckless thing to do. ......"

It was the right thing to do.

The only one who couldn't see what was going on was Gavil, but that couldn't be helped. It was as if Carrera, who was good at magic, had thrown back her most powerful magic. It's hard to believe it even when it's explained to you, so it's absurd to ask you to imagine it.

It was hard to believe that such a thing was possible in the first place.

Anyway, for now, they had to let Geld and the others do their best, and everyone prepared for the impact with bated breath.

And then, for a while, there was a violent flicker of light, a shock that turned the heavens and the earth upside down.

It will gradually subside and eventually subside.

Finally, after the shaking had disappeared, Carrera opened his mouth.

"I can't believe someone would do this. If this had been Mirim's magic, I'm not sure what would have happened."

I'm sure you'll be able to understand what I mean. I'm sure you'll be able to understand why.

This time, the power was reduced to less than 30%, so we managed to endure it somehow. Even so, the terrain around the castle was badly damaged, and the streets and other parts of the city were no longer visible.

Reconstructing it was a headache, but fortunately there was no human casualty, which was a good thing.

But what if this is the "Dragon Star Bombing Flame"?

"Ha-ha-ha!　It's not that easy to control my magic. Maybe, but I think only some of the power was returned to you."

We may not be able to prevent even some of that." What do you call it?　That magic is based on an unknown theory. It's impossible to rewrite the laws, and I'm not sure we can defend ourselves well."

Carrera replied honestly.

Karela was good at magic, but Mirim's magic was on another level. To be honest, she knew better than anyone how bad it was because she was always competing with him for power.

If that's the case, Gavil asked the question.

If that were the case, then the enemy could not have thrown back Lord Mirim's magic, could they?"

That was a very good point.

Gavil is surprisingly smart, and these perspectives have excellent sensitivity.

It was Mirim who answered this.

"No, it was returned. I'm not sure what to make of that. I'm sure he specializes in computing power, but I'm sure he can change the flow of any directional magic, regardless of its nature.

Carrera agrees with this.

I agree with you. I hate to admit it, but I think the bigger and more complex the magic, the easier it is for him to manipulate. Even if this were a base-triggered Flame of Doom, he'd be able to anticipate the point of activation and cut off that space to nullify it.

If it's a magic that doesn't have a time delay in its activation, you won't have time to pass it off, but that won't give you a fatal wound. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're going to do, and how you're going to do it.

Anyway, it is troublesome to have someone on the enemy side who is good at magic.

"I'm sorry, sir. If I knew more about the Pollywogs, I would have stopped you from doing such a dangerous thing. ......"

Obera apologized and bowed, but there was no one to blame her.

Well, I guess that's that.

"That's right. In fact, we were able to reduce the number of enemies with zero damage, so if you just look at the results, it's a huge success!"

Well, since ...... you're safe, there's no point in complaining, and for now, let's think about our next move.

Mirim and Frey were right.

It is true that Carrera's blow has greatly reduced the enemy's strength, and the morale of the generals who do not know the situation is high. It would be more meaningful to strike the enemy with this momentum than to pursue responsibility.

From now on, no more magic.

"No objections!"

Carrera responds to Frey's decision.

"Then let's go head-to-head in a straightforward manner.

"That sounds interesting. There is no sign of the enemy king, but there are about eight generals. We have exactly the same number of generals as they do, so we can set a quota of one per person.

When Carrion expressed his opinion as a general, Midlai said something stupid.

It is Carrera who rides it.

"Hahahaha, that's funny. Then I'll take the one that's slumped over.

The person in front of his gaze is Zeth, sitting on the back of a flying polymath. He is the head of the Mushimaru, and his dignity is tremendous.

It's not fair!　Then I..."

"No, Mirim. You're the general, you have to stand your ground."

That's right. If we're in trouble, you'll have to come in and save us."

"Mmm, mmm, I get it."

After stopping Milim from entering the fray, Frey went on to look around the battlefield and declared.

That's why I'm going to deal with that flying winged insect.

As I looked at him, I saw a flying goldfish.　There was Torn.


As Carrera and Frey took the lead, the rest of us began to panic.

"Then I'll..."

"I am..."

"I am..."

Carrion, Gavil, and Midray opened their mouths at the same time and their gazes crossed.

Well, I guess the sooner the better, huh?

"Hmm, good. It's been a while since I've really gone wild.

"So do I!　Then let's play this game like normal!"

There was no time to stop.

The three of them ran out of the castle as if they were checking each other out.

As if caught up in this, the armies began to move. Thus, the curtain of the Great War was dropped.






*






Gerudo bowed to Mirim and then left to take command.

All that remained were Mirim, Obera, and Esprit.

You're not going?"

When Esprit was asked that, she spoke her mind, even though she didn't want to.

In the event that you've got a problem with your own personal computer, you'll be able to use your own personal computer. If I overreact and end up losing, I'll be dragging my feet. ......"

It was a very wise decision.

For once, Esprit wasn't slacking off.

"That's right. I'm not sure what to make of it. I don't have a lot of experience fighting them, but I know that they are not someone you can let your guard down against.

In fact, many of my friends have been killed by the pollywogs.

In particular, Zes, where Carrera was headed, was said to be a challenge even for Zalario. To be honest, Obera himself could not be certain that he would be able to win.

Therefore, the three remaining members of the group decided to continue watching the battle.


The first to meet was Carrera, who took the lead.

Out of the way.

With that, he punched the elephant to death and ran across the battlefield at once. Then, at the end of the line, he fired the golden gun he had pulled out at Zeth, who was standing leisurely.

But Zeth avoided this with ease.

Even a supersonic bullet at close range was an insignificant toy to Zeth.

"Well, that's great."

Carrera is impressed.

As it was, he transformed the golden gun into a military sword with a shining golden blade.

"It's Carrera. He's the one who's going to reap your life."

"Nonsense. You can start talking nonsense like that after you get me up on my feet.

With those words as a signal, the battle began.


Even without waiting for an order, the "Tenshoushu" surrounded Frey, who jumped out at the same time as Carrera. Naturally, the "Milim Guard" followed suit.

He didn't devote himself to guarding Mirim, but that wasn't a problem since his role would change in wartime.

In the first place, Mirim didn't need any guards. Now that Obera was still around, Frey could go on a rampage without worry.

That's why Frey came into contact with Torn while kicking flying bugs around.

Torun was a polly general who protected himself with a shiny metallic exoskeleton.

He was stocky and not very smart. Up close, he was surprisingly large, reaching a height of two meters. However, it is not to be underestimated. By using its two pairs of wings like a dragonfly, it was able to fly at will.

The moment Frey thought he had struck the first blow, he was evaded, which led him to realize that Torn was a nuisance.

Torn dodged a claw strike from a high-speed flight while staying in the air. This was due to the difference in flight methods, and it seemed that Torn had the advantage in aerial combat.

In any case, Torn's compound eyes were able to catch Frey's movements as if they were in slow motion. Although he was inferior to Frey in terms of straight line speed, he could easily predict where Frey was going to move, so avoiding him was a piece of cake.

Torun did not have any special powers. His power was divided between the strength of his exoskeleton, future prediction, and flight speed. It was a simple, yet very strong ability structure.

In particular, the nature of his fist was a special substance called bio-different steel, and its strength surpassed even that of bio-demonic steel. It boasted a strength that could even reach the mythical level.

With all the important elements of combat - reaction speed, defense, and attack power - Torn was inferior to Frey in existence value, but exceeded him in combat ability.

Frey, who had planned to take out the enemy general with his momentum, was about to suffer a huge miscalculation.

But here is where Torn misspoke.

"Squeak, squeak, squeak. You're too slow. I'm fast.

What?"

With this one word, Frey snapped.

Later, Mirim will tell the story.

Frey is not a warmonger. He said, "Anyone who makes a stupid remark will know firsthand how foolish it is.

Mirim's words carried weight because she was always being scolded.

And Torn would know the meaning of this in his own body.


Gavil was chasing after Frey with the "Flying Dragons" in tow.

"Everyone, the enemy is a bug-shaped demonic beast, the same species as Zegion and Apito. I'm sure you understand its strength, but don't let your guard down!

His men nodded loudly at Gavil's loud reminder.

They had always been beaten badly in their combat training in the labyrinth. Everyone understood the danger and was overly cautious.

Gavil proceeds to reap the swarms of bugs that fill the sky with his breath. Kakushin, Sukero, and Yashichi followed Gavil.

"Hey, hey, Gabil-sama!　Are you going to help Master Frey?"

"Hmm?　If you're struggling, that's fine too..."

Gavil didn't seem to be keen on Yashichi's question. That would not please Frey, he thought.

More importantly, there was something that bothered me.

"Mmm, Master Gavril!　There's something in there that looks bad."

Skellow found the person Gavil had been worried about.

"Indeed. It vaguely resembles Apito-dono, but I sense a more vicious presence!"

And Kakushin shows the same reaction as Gavil's concern.

Yes, Gavil also felt that the existence of this person was a greater threat than Apito.

Apito's existence value is lower than Gavil's, but when it comes to battle, they are almost evenly matched. His victory rate is not that high, and he always has a hard time.

And yet, the presence of this person was more disastrous than Apito.

Gavil's instincts told him.

He's in trouble.

That person's name was Beat Hop. He was a general with the characteristics of a bee and a grasshopper.

As for Gavil, he was at a loss to decide.

If it was just me, I would still be in a position to take care of the lives of my subordinates.

He thought that since he had received orders from Rimuru to never die, he should not challenge a battle where the odds were uncertain.

He had gotten carried away by Carrion and Midray's enthusiasm, but Gavil was not that much of a fighter. He wanted to test his skills as a warrior, but he didn't want to exchange lives.

(Besides, if I were to get seriously injured here, Sokka might insulate me. I made him cry the last time, and I don't know how hard I had to work to get him in a good mood after that. ......)

Gavil wept at the bitter memory.

There is no need to give up the advantage of being able to fly. You don't have to go to the trouble of challenging a dangerous opponent here, just find an opponent that you can win against more easily.

Gavil thought about it and tried to find another general - but he was too naive to think that way.

Hey, don't run!

Beat hop was a fearsome polly general.

He had closed the large distance between them in an instant and was floating in front of Gavil.

"What?"

The reason why Gavil was able to react to the beat-hop kick that was unleashed in a moment was because he was used to Apito's speed. In addition to that, the fact that the water vortex spear had been raised to a mythical level of performance, it was able to withstand the kick.

Like Torn, Beat Hop also had the exoskeleton of his limbs turned into bio-different steel.

And the vital parts of the head and torso.

He had a slender body, and his flying speed exceeded even that of Torn. His defense was equal to Torn's, but his offense was greater than Torn's. He was a general with foul fighting abilities.

Even if you simply compare the value of their existence, they are superior to Gavil. If it were Frey, it would be a heavy burden for Gavil to bear.

But now that it was like this, there was no way to escape. The only way to survive was to fight and win, Gavil thought to himself.

"No shortage of opponents!　My name is Gavil!　I'm the one appointed by Lord Rimuru as the "Heavenly Dragon King."

Gavil spoke up and confronted Beat Hop.


Carrion runs the earth.

It was followed by a policeman with spider-like limbs growing on his back.

"My name is Abarth. You're a killer."

"Tell me. Don't tell me what I can't do!"

While running, there was an offensive and defensive battle going on between them.

The strength of the divine Carrion is not half bad. If it had been a one-on-one match with no second thoughts, he would have unleashed his Beast King Flash Howl and defeated Abarth long ago.

However, this is not the case because this is a battlefield. There are other enemy generals, and you can't show your inner hand carelessly.

Besides, unlike in the labyrinth, if you die, it's over. The important thing in a battle is to survive, so we needed to find a way to fight without overworking ourselves while preserving our strength.

However, this was a decision he made because he thought his opponent was of a lower rank than him. In the face of a truly formidable opponent, Carrion would have given it his all without thinking about the consequences.

Instinctively, however, Carrion did not doubt his victory.

Abarth's existence value is less than half of Carrion's. Although he has the same combat-focused ability structure as the other Mushin generals, it is the same with Carrion.

In this game, Carrion had the advantage.


What Midgley encountered was Saril, whose body surface was wet with a liquid that was poisonous to look at. The reddish-purple luster of the exoskeleton was, needless to say, bio-different steel. And from its tail oozed a deadly poison that would kill anyone who touched it.

The Poisonous Scorpion, Salil.

It was a difficult opponent for those who excelled in martial arts.

But that doesn't apply to Midray.

"Well, I'm in a bit of a pickle."

"Keke. You're a lucky bastard to be standing in front of Oreti.

"Luck?　You seem to have misunderstood, so let me tell you, luck is not a factor in combat.

"What?"

In the world, there are certainly phenomena such as lucky punches and giant killings, where a lower-ranked fighter beats a higher-ranked fighter. However, it is the result of hard work and the achievement of a person who has honed his own unique weapon that can be used against a superior. If it's just luck, it's not worth the effort, right?

What are you trying to say, asshole?

"Hmm, let me put it bluntly then. I'm strong."

As soon as he announced this, Midray disappeared.

No, no.

He closed the distance in an instant with a "blink method" that even Saril's perception couldn't catch.

Saril was blown away. It was the result of Midgley's fist smashing into his face.

"Hmm, a little painful, but you get used to it."

Midlai's fist was smoking purple as he muttered this.

It's Saril's poison. I'm sure you'll be able to understand why. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're doing.

What the hell is wrong with you?　You've been poisoned by Oreti, and you're not even afraid..."

"It's all about spirit. If you can't do something like this, you can't be Milim's playmate!"

Midgley shouts.

Regardless of the theory, it was loud enough to upset Salil.

At first glance, Midgley doesn't look very strong.

That's why Salil is confused.

（No, that's crazy!　There's no way I could hit Orechi's exoskeleton with my bare hands and be safe. And yet, what the hell is going on?)

Despite his thoughts, Salil believes that his victory is unassailable.

There was no way that a mere fragile human being could harm himself as a politician.

However, it was a naive idea.

Midray.

He may look like a human, but his true nature is that of a true dragon man, just like Gavil.

And...

Normally, he hid his abilities perfectly with his "chi fighting method", but Midray's existence value reached twice as much as Gavil's.

Now, against Saril, Midgley is coming into his own.


After returning to the front line, Gerudo tells his men.

"Our job is to make sure no enemy gets through."

"Yes!" "Yes!"

All of the generals responded to Gerudo's order with great enthusiasm.

There was no fear in his expression, and he looked coldly at the approaching enemy.

The enemy's army, but in different forms.

It looks like a demon that has taken several features of a large insect and turned them into a monster.

There were few humanoid forms, but strangely enough, the closer they got to human form, the stronger they seemed to become.

At that moment, Gerudo's gaze settled on a single point.

He was sitting on the back of a huge hundred-legged creature that looked to be over thirty meters long. From his overwhelming presence, I guessed that he was definitely one of the Mushi generals.

I'll deal with him.

Several of the deputies nodded at Gerudo's murmur.

Good luck!

With that voice in his back, Gerudo took a step forward.


Esprit picked up his sword.

Mirim calls out to Esprit as he heads for the window.

Are you going?"

"Ah, yes. It seems that Carrera-sama is having a hard time, so I thought I'd help out in a small way.

Esprit replied in a casual tone, as if he was going for a short walk.

As I observed from here, the polly general who was dealing with Carrera - Zeth - had a fearsome fighting ability. Moreover, the period was interfering with Carrera's magic, and he was on the defensive.

At this point, he could no longer stand by and watch because he was weak. That's why Esprit took out the sword that he had been hiding without hesitation.

It was one that Kurobei had forged, and it was a work of art equivalent to the legendary level.

Esprit, who had dismissed all but magic as useless to demons, had come to learn swords in secret.

It was also a hobby that Esprit's boss, Carrera, was into, so it was a point he wanted to keep in mind as his subordinate. More than that, the experience of fighting together with Agera caught Esprit's interest.

Esprit thought it would be interesting to have a demon that specialized in swordsmanship, and began to secretly work on developing a magical sword.

It was not really time to put it into actual combat, but now was not the time to talk about it. The period's anti-magic capabilities were so great that esprit de corps would not work. It was humiliating, but it was true.

Then, he thought, I'll use my magic sword instead of magic.

"Well, the enemy doesn't seem to care about one on one, so we have to move too. That's why I'm going to go now!

He said cheerfully, and Mirim smiled.

"Mmm, go do your best!"

And so, with Mirim seeing him off, Esprit went off to the battlefield.


Now, only Milim and Obera remained in the keep of the skyscraper that Frey boasted of.

Here, Obera opens his mouth.

Then, Master Milim, I will be on my way."

"Mmm?　You're not hurt anymore?"

I'm sorry to have caused you so much worry. I'm sure you've already recovered, so please don't worry about me.

You're a hard man, you know that?

Obera chuckled when he heard Mirim's dumbfounded voice.

It's in my nature. And, as you may have already noticed..."

"Hmm. You are the master of the sticky presence that seems to envelop this battlefield, aren't you?"

"Yes."

He nodded, and Obera's expression tightened.

"Zelanus, the king of bugs and demons, is incredibly strong. I'm afraid I'm no match for him, so please be very careful.

In truth, it would be best if Mirim never came into play. But if Zelanus made a move, they would have no way to stop him themselves, Obera guessed.

That's why we have to rely on Mirim, even though we are unwilling to do so.

Therefore, he wanted to reduce the number of enemy generals as quickly as possible.

Just now, Obera's eyes caught sight of a single free-roaming Mushroom General - Tisshorn, whose hands had become sharp blades. He thought he should take it out and use the momentum to cover the others.

It was now a race against time.

I want to take out as many generals as possible before Zeranus makes his move. However, the enemy's strength was so unknown that it would not be so easy.

"From what I can tell, there are several dangerous ones. Obera, please help me get them all back safely."

"Yes, sir!"

Obera was elated.

How pleasant it is to be commanded by one's lord.

Unlike the battles I had fought out of a sense of duty, I felt as if my strength was coming from the bottom of my heart.

(Oh, yeah? Did you guys do that too?　If so, I wish I could have rewarded you more.)

The sentimentality is fleeting.

The fact that Obera is alive now is the result of inheriting the wishes of his dear subordinates.

If that's the case, we can't just stop.

I'll be there.

"Mmm!　I expect results!

With Mirim's encouragement, Obera also headed for the battlefield.

And so, the war grows more intense...

CHAPTER 3

The meeting proceeded smoothly.

All of this was possible thanks to the advance planning.

Since the necessary number of votes for the resolution had already been secured, there was no chance of an upset here.

In the first place, there was no way that anyone would be stupid enough to oppose a settlement with the Empire when it was about to be reached.

That's why Masayuki stood up as the emperor to sign the settlement document.

Loud cheers and applause filled the assembly hall as we all watched Masayuki ascend to the podium.

Exactly as planned.

Testarossa and the others who had been working towards this day were also smiling with satisfaction. She was definitely the one who did the work in the shadows, so I'll give her a pat on the back later.

Now, get your ass over here and sign it.

Then a fun standing party will follow.

Hinata also changed her color, and I am sure she will show us another beautiful dress this time.

I've made all the preparations in advance, and I've properly asked Luminous to help me with this.

This time, I asked him to tailor a very aggressive design for me.

It's perfect.

The bribe was expensive, but it was a like-minded person.

Luminous has been understanding and has convinced us to pay a very reasonable price.

I don't care about autographs anymore, just move to the party venue... Perhaps it was my fault that I was filled with evil thoughts, but a loud explosion sounded from the direction of the venue.

A beat later, the chamber also shook.

"Masayuki, are you okay?"

What's going on?"

Don't make love right next to me.

The perfect bodyguard, Ms. Verglind, is by Masayuki's side, but she is not allowed to make out with her whenever she has a chance.

So I don't need to worry about that, but I'll be the one to entertain them.

Masayuki, are you okay?"

"Oh, I'm fine. I'm glad to hear that you're all okay..."

As he said this, Masayuki was looking around the assembly hall.

I took the opportunity to look at it, and found that it was as calm as you'd expect from an elected representative of a country.

"Of course. You can't work with me if you're flustered by something like this."

Before I knew it, Testarossa was organizing everyone as if nothing had happened. With her precise instructions, the knights guarding the chamber were also moving around in an orderly fashion.

I've ordered the Holy Knights to be on the lookout. I've sent them to investigate what happened at the party, not to mention the area around the council chamber."

Oh, hi.

When Hinata came to my side and told me this, I also remembered an important issue.

Yes, I wonder if the party venue is safe.

Even if the delicacies we had prepared could be handled, if the venue itself was severely damaged, it would affect tonight's buffet party.

I didn't think it was going to be cancelled. ......

Are you nuts?

If that happened, I wouldn't be able to see Hinata in her dress.

Such anxiety flashed through my mind, and I tried to run in a panic.

But then.

"Master Rimuru!　I've just received a call from Lord Frey. I'm sure you'll be able to understand that I'm not the only one.

Benimaru delivered an inexplicably cruel report that shattered my faintest remaining hopes.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

I'm in trouble, Limuru!　I've been communicating with each of the Demon Lords as prescribed, but I haven't heard back from Damorgania. This is not good, is it?

It's not good.

Of all the possible situations, no contact would be the most dangerous.

This is why I had prepared a manual for just such a situation, and while complaining in my heart, I told him to continue to gather information through thought transference.

Ramiris also seemed to remember the existence of the manual after I pointed it out. I'm not in a hurry at all.

Anyway, without information, there is no way to make a decision.

That being said, maybe I should give up on the standing room only party tonight. ......

At times like this, I am reminded of events from my previous life.

Yes, that was when I was still in my twenties and working as a foreman.

It was the scheduled day for a major update to the MMORPG that had become part of my daily routine, and I was excitedly waiting for work to end.

Just when we were almost finished with the work, the machine broke down. ......

No way, I thought.

We hadn't even finished cleaning up the site when the construction equipment stopped working. Until the repairs were completed, other work would be halted, and this was the moment that ...... overtime was fixed.

I instructed them to arrange for night lighting, contacted the authorities and the police to explain the situation, and finished the work as much as I could by myself. I also went around to explain the situation to the local residents as necessary, so I had no time to grieve.

I had so much to do that I found myself long past my regular time.

The way I feel now is just like the way I felt then.

In other words, he told her to give up on Hinata's dress.

If we invade two places at the same time, we will have to prepare for a long battle. It would be impossible to finish the job before nightfall.

There was a good chance that one of them would be a decoy, and there was no way he could handle it in a happy mood.

However, I was determined not to forget the resentment that welled up in my heart.

I need to teach these fools a lesson that the price of taking away my fun will be high. ......

With that in mind, I changed my mind and began to think of countermeasures.






*






Hinata noticed the change in me.

What's wrong with you?"

I nodded and explained briefly.

"Oh, there's movement in the enemy. It looks like something's going on over here too, but..."

Yeah, we'll take care of that.

Hinata is the one.

I didn't have to ask him to do it, he just agreed.

Testarossa, I need you to work with Hinata to get things under control."

I know what I'm doing.

There we go.

I decided to put this behind me for now and get a status report from Benimaru.

"Benimaru, what's the status on the follow-up?"

I'm still checking, but it looks like things are pretty bad.

There was an unhurried response, but the situation seemed to be quite tense. I waited for the rest of the report, hoping that the damage had not exceeded our expectations.

I've been contacted. I'm surprised, but it seems that the forces are evenly matched. It seems that Carrera's supreme magic was the beacon that started the war, but it seems that the enemy had someone who could throw it back at them, and it turned into a straight-up slugfest..."

Throw back Carrera's magic!

I was wondering how to use magic with such crazy power... but I guess it's possible if it's a "space control" type of power?


It depends on the computing power, but it is possible. It depends on the scale and power of the magic, but if it's a directional destructive magic, the strategy of distorting space to pass the power is effective. If you make a mistake, your allies will be harmed, and I don't recommend it.


I see.

If you take the time to predict the point of impact, there's a risk that your allies will get caught in the middle.

Also, it goes without saying that failure to predict would be a huge blow. I'm sure you can do it, Ciel, but unless you have any other moves, I'd dismiss it.

If you think about it, it's a strategy that comes at the expense of your allies, and the risk of failure is too great, so it seems that the enemy has some pretty daredevil gamblers.

It was because of him that we came into a head-on collision, and the enemy had eight policemen.

Officially, they are called the Twelve Mushi Generals, but now there are only eight of them left, not twelve, so they were all together.

In addition to this, there is a hint of the "King of Mushrooms and Demons" Zelanus, and Mirim is unable to move. So, the four heavenly kings of Mirim and even Karela and the others have all joined in to fight against the Mushimaru.

What are the Four Heavenly Kings of Mirim?　The question "What are the Four Heavenly Kings?

"And you think you're going to win?"

"I'm not sure, but I'm sure there are some tough opponents out there."

"All right. Anyway, let's send out reinforcements.

"I've already sent out three hundred Red Flames in anticipation of you saying that.

Oh, Benimaru is still excellent.

They didn't take their time and moved quickly to make a decision.

The "magic circle for transfer" can only take about fifty people at a time, but it can operate continuously if we replenish the magical elements ourselves. And since there is an abundance of magical elements in our labyrinth, the time it takes to reuse them can be shortened.

This time, Verdra was cooperating with us, so we were able to send 300 people out safely.

The conductor, Govor, was also very motivated.

I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one who's had it. Well, I don't think he's going to fall behind that easily.

'That's all well and good, but I'm not sure we have enough strength.

When you hear that the number of enemies exceeds one million, you may feel uneasy with only three hundred people. The quality of the individual players was all above A-rank, so they were very well equipped. However, if they made a series of mistakes due to fatigue, it would not be surprising if they collapsed at once.

Do you want me to send the gopher?

Hmm, a hundred wolf demon troops.

Our country has the protection of the labyrinth, and there is no place for the goblins. Or rather, we don't want them to be there.

If you're a wolf demon soldier with excellent mobility, a large battlefield is a more suitable place for you to work. If you want them to fight in the labyrinth, it means that you are in a very tight situation.

Then again, it's probably a bad idea to leave it out here.

'Okay, let's do it. Ranga, I need you to follow the goblins and protect him!

"Yes!"

Ranga's presence disappeared from my shadow.

As I was thinking that this was a relief, I felt Benimaru laughing at me.

"Limuru-sama, as always, has a soft spot for goblins.

"Oh, really?"

"Yes. I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you.

"But, you know, he's a little off sometimes, right?"

I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not. But this time, overprotection might be the right answer. ......"

Benimaru's happy mood had changed.

Apparently, he sensed something disturbing in the enemy's appearance.

'Which means, even in your estimation, the enemy is strong?

It's creepy. I'm seeing through the eyes of Gerudo and the others, but the bugs have no fear. They are tireless and continue to attack over the corpses of their comrades.

"Wow, what a nasty enemy. ......"

"Geld says it reminds him of the time when we were under the rule of his father, the king.

"Ah, the unique skill of the Starving Man. ......"

That's another memory I'd rather hate than miss.

But the image came through.

'Anyway, I hope everyone is safe. If the worst happens, don't hesitate to go for backup."

"I know."

That was how I ended my conversation with Benimar.






*






Ramiris was the next to call out.

"Well, did you get a response?"

"Wait a minute. I'm in the middle of something important, and it's not Limuru!　Listen to me, it wasn't that bad!

It's so noisy.

I'm sure you've mistaken me for someone else, but there's no way I could have mixed up my thought transfer in this situation. I'm not sure what to make of this.

It was. I trusted Trainee and Beretta because they were handling the situation, but I felt it was wrong to put Ramiris in command. ......

"Can you put Beretta on for a minute?"

"Oh, wait a minute. You can trust me..."

I don't care.

"Yes."

The players were replaced without warning.

It's not that I'm dragging Hinata into this, and it's not that I'm taking it out on her, but this is an emergency situation. It's not a game.

So, we hear from Beretta.

"I just received a call from Zonda-dono. She has escaped to the area where she can talk, by order of Ultima-sama.

That's what Ultima is all about. Unlike some slack-jawed fairy, she was acting according to the manual.

"And the enemy?"

I'm not sure what to do.　I'm sure you'll be able to figure out what to do.

Hmmm, that suggestion is also possible, but I am concerned about the fact that they are terribly powerful. If we were to move our troops, there was a high possibility that we would fall into the enemy's trap, and if possible, we wanted to keep our forces at a minimum.

Before that, this is the dominant territory of Luminous. We can't borrow from Luminous.

Leon had fallen into the hands of the enemy, and Guy didn't want to move him from guarding the golden land of El Dorado. If Velzard attacked, but other than that, I felt it was the right thing to leave him in place.

If that's the case, I'm the only one left who can put up a fight. ......

I pondered what I should do.

Either we send out the labyrinthine forces or I'll head out on my own.

I'm also concerned about this place, but I don't see any major signs. Testarossa is here, and Hinata and the Holy Knights are also working.

We can expect reinforcements from Luminous if necessary, and what's more, we have Mr. Verglind.

And then...

"Oh, Master Rimuru!　I've got a follow-up report on the enemy's formation. I'm sure you're not the only one.

When I heard that, my mind was made up.

If Leon was there, I was supposed to be the one to go to him.

Now there was no more hesitation. We should follow the manual here and have Leon returned to our camp.

Well, I still had some unfinished business, but I was going to turn it into anger and take it out on my enemy.

'Okay, I'll head out. I'll leave the command there to Benimar, and tell Ramiris to take his training seriously.

"Yes, sir."

There was an indescribable sadness in Beretta's voice, but I got her point. I'm not saying that you shouldn't play commander, but you need to learn the manual properly.

Well, I have to admit that I think it might have been a mistake to make the "control room" look so luxurious.

I've recreated it from my memory and redecorated it to look as gorgeous as any anime or manga. Because I wasted so much money and did whatever I wanted, everyone wanted to sit in the commander's chair, which was annoying.

I've even prepared a special seat for Ramiris, so he's already in the groove. ......

It would be fine if we were just playing games, but this was a serious battle. I made sure to nail him to the wall so that he would do his duty.






◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇






A gentleman stands in front of Daguerre.

Fenn.

The reason he looks like a gentleman is because the comparison is to Daguerre. Fenn is slender but tall like a giant, with supple muscles that are toned.

Her skin was white. Her skin is morbidly white, as if the pigment has been drained from her skin after being quarantined in a room without sunlight for an uncanny number of years.

Her green hair was shaggy and long, and her eyes shone like jade.

She wore a loose, long robe with a bare chest. The accent was on the chains wrapped around her waist and shoulders.

The Holy Demon Seal chain that had bound him for years was now Fen's favorite.

With an elusive movement, Fen walked toward Daguerre, his body swaying back and forth.

At first glance, it seems defenseless, but it's not.

The movements are like those of a martial arts master, able to respond immediately to any attack.

Smirking, Fen laughs.

I've missed you, brother.

When Fen called out to him, Daguerre let out a big sigh.

I sure missed you, but I never wanted to see you again.

"Oh, come on, don't be so lonely. You're only three brothers, aren't you?

You're right. That's why I'm so sorry I took a wrong turn."

"Ha!　You've changed, bro. You used to be such a good-looking guy."

Fen responds with a frustrated look.

To Feng, Daguerre was an admirer.

And yet, now he feels as if his fangs have been pulled out and he's become gutless and uninteresting.

"We once defied the Lord Vardanava. And now you know the reality."

That's your excuse, right?　I don't approve of that.

We are only alive because of his kindness.　We're only alive because of his kindness!

That's the thing, I don't like my brother being such a pussy!　What about the Vedanavas? If Feldway resurrects the Vedanavas, then I'll see who's better, black and white.

You idiot!　You don't know him...

I don't want to discuss it anymore. I'm done arguing. Let's have a fight. I'll beat my brother and wake him up.

"Fen, you ......"

The bodies of both Fen and Daguerre were enveloped in a swirling atmosphere of battle. The "Tentongkaku", which is supposed to be indestructible, shook greatly under the tremendous pressure.

The next moment, Daguerre's fist was thrust into Feng's face with an impact that pierced the heavens and the earth.

But Feng held his ground.

Then, in return, he sank his hips deep and delivered a heavy, sharp uppercut into Daguerre's stomach.

Daguerre's body floated in the air. I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one.

The impact of Daguerre's huge body hitting the wall made the "Tentongkaku" creak as if it was about to collapse.

But Daguerre got up as if nothing had happened.

"Chi, you haven't lost your touch."

"You too. Any normal guy would have finished by now."

"Don't underestimate me. "Don't underestimate me. The name 'Eight-Star Demon King' is not a fluke."

You like that, huh?

Pretty much!

As soon as he answered that, Daguerre released his fighting spirit with all his might.

In terms of existence value, Daguerre is over 40 million. In the event that you have any questions regarding where and the best way to get in touch with us, please do not hesitate to contact us.


Leon quietly descends onto the battlefield.

Standing in front of him was Daguerre's younger brother and Fen's older brother, Glassord.

He was about two meters tall, which was large for other races, but belonged to the small category of giants. His skin color was also yellow, somewhere between that of his older and younger brothers.

Her eyes are purple and have an intellectual glow to them. She has a tendency to think that she should be the one to take care of herself because she has had a hard time being caught between her bohemian older brother and her free-spirited younger brother.

He is aware of this, but he can't help his innate temperament.

Because of this, he is a fan of the two-handed greatsword, a weapon that emphasizes skill, which is rare among the Titan race, which excels at bare-handed or clubbed weapons that rely on brute force.

It's a completely offensive fighting style without a shield, but that's exactly how confident Glassord is.

Although Glassord's existence value was less than two million, making him seem vulnerable among his siblings, he was undoubtedly a talented super-awakened person.

And his skills are the best of the three brothers...

"I see you are the Demon Lord Leon. My name is Glassord. I am the second-in-command of the Titan Corps. I would have liked to test my skills against you, who has not been deprived of his free will, but that will have to wait for another time... I will let you win today.

Glassord said his name and stepped in front of Leon.


The gentlemanly Veyron stood in front of Dino, who had come to him in a dour mood.

Veyron was a duke-ranked demon lord, the second most powerful after Grand Duke Moss. However, he had to admit that his odds against a pillar of the "primordial" that was comparable to the "primordial" were not just a little, but extremely bad.

Still, it was better than the Lord dealing with two such "primordial" beings at the same time, and he intended to fulfill his role to the fullest.

In other words, stall for time.

"Dino won't take it seriously anyway, so I think you can be his opponent. If I go out, Dino might get serious. So I'll leave this to you, Veyron."

When asked so adorably, Veyron had no choice but to refuse. In order to live up to his master's expectations, he was determined to give it his all.

Well, I guess I have to fight, too. ......

If you'd like to stall for time, I'd be more than happy to do so.

"You can't do that, can you? Unfortunately for me, I'm not even allowed to slack off now."

Dino answered in such a way, but he was still checking how much was acceptable. It was frustrating to not be able to tell him that, but he was relieved to be able to say the next line.

"Well, if it's Ultima, I'll take you on with just my swordplay."

In other words, it's a declaration of non-use of authority.

He knew from the way Leon was fighting that he didn't have to fight with all his might. If Leon was serious, it would have been a more fierce battle.

Dino had once observed Leon's true fighting style. The flash of his sword was like light, and had the power to slice through even the spirit child. As long as he remembered that, he could not believe that the current Leon was serious.

So Dino imitates him.

It's not about skipping work, but about not betraying your friends, you tell yourself.

After observing Dino, Veyron also understood. The demon was wise to the subtleties of human nature and the movements of the heart.

(Hmm. As Ultima-sama read, Dino-sama doesn't seem to be interested in this fight. If that's the case, then it seems that I'm a good enough opponent.)

Once you know that, it's easy to talk.

I pretend to be provoked by Dino and return the favor.

You've been lied to. Then I'll break your arrogant nose.

Having said that, Veyron performed the change by the ultimate gift, "The Authentic Writer".

The imitation is, of course, the younger version of Araki Byakuya, Agera's previous life.

In his hand was the sword that Kurobei had forged. It was a legendary work of art, made to resemble a walking stick.

In fact, Kurobeh, he had come here to improve his skills.

Like the sword he had given to Esprit, he had become an incredibly skilled swordsmith, with seven or eight of his ten swords being of legendary quality.

No, in fact, it will not be long before he reaches the level of a "divine master.

Such a sword forged by Crovey fit well in Veyron's hands. Although it was limited to the use of the ultimate gift "Authentic Writer", Veyron began to understand the charm of the sword.

"Interesting. I'm gonna get a little serious."

It is a lie.

Dino's eyes wavered uneasily.

(You're okay, right?　You know exactly what I'm talking about, don't you?)

That's what I'm desperately asking myself.

Veyron nodded broadly to reassure him.

"I'll borrow your chest. So be gentle with me!"

He responded and turned Dino into a smile.


Ultima stood alone in front of Pico and Galasha.

"Oh, come on, primordial purple. No, it's Ultima now. I'm sure you understand the situation, but don't tell me you want to take on Attai and the others by yourself?"

Galusha asked.

Ultima responded with a smile.

"Well, that's no problem. As for me, I think you guys are just the right size to get used to it.

"Hmmm... ......, we've been licked... ......"

"I'm pissed off, too. I won't forgive you if you cry!"

Unlike Dino and the Veyron group, this one was a very serious confrontation.

Or rather, Ultima was even enjoying this situation.

He had assessed Pico and Galasha's fighting abilities and concluded that these two were weaker than he was.

That reading is correct.

Pico and Galasha are not weak, and as a matter of course they are super awakened, but their existence value is around 2 million, which is one step below Ultima.

In addition, Ultima had the rare experience of winning a battle to the death against a competitor of equal ability. This fact confirmed Ultima's confidence, and he thought that these two were the right people to use as a touchstone to hone their skills.

If you hit him, maybe he'll get his free will back, and I'll help him."

That's the one that's never gonna work.

"Yes, yes. It's none of your business!"

While exchanging such light words, the slugfest began.






*






The battle between Daguerre and Feng was a tormenting one to watch from the sidelines.

In reality, however, neither of them were serious. If they had been serious, everyone in the same room would have been subjected to the pressure of the fighting spirit, and some of them would not have been able to stand up.

At the very least, it would have been less of a fight.

However, the time for such wait-and-see will soon be over.

The other groups did not want to fight in a small building and moved to their own battlefields.

As a result, Daguerre and the others were the only ones left in the multi-story "Tentongkaku" structure.

"It's been a while since I've been this hot. Brother, I'm about to get serious."

"Huh!　I wish."

Fen's fighting spirit swelled.

The power that rivaled that of the dragon species became a visible pressure that blew into Daguerre.

However, Daguerre was not to be outdone.

"Nuh-uh!"

And by acclimatizing his own fighting spirit into his body, he transformed his muscles into something specialized for combat.

So began a full-blown sibling rivalry, but the goal was mutual and non-negotiable.

As for Feng, he wants Daguerre to go back to the days when he was on a rampage.

Daguerre, on the other hand, was seeking stability and order. He would not hesitate to go to war if necessary, but he was not a thinker who would go on a futile rampage.

Incompatible arguments. But the winner of this fight can make the other side do his bidding.

Because...

The battle intensified further.

And so, little by little, the tightly contested game began to tilt in Fen's favor.

The difference in strength was apparent.

In addition to that, the clincher was the chain that Fen could control at will - the Holy Demon Sealing Chain.

It's an indestructible chain, created by Vedanava with his own hands, and it's one of the strongest and most flexible chains in the mythical class. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.

"Kuh, to hunt down the cocky ...... eagle this far, you've gained even more strength than before..."

Daguerre was caught in the middle, and his hands and feet were bound together with the chains of the Holy Demon Seal.

He spilled out with a look of anguish on his face.

Fen smirks.

"My brother... you can take the memory of my bitterness that I have tasted.

He then launched into a powerful headbutt.

A moment later, Daguerre and Feng's "souls" touched, and their memories and emotions crossed.

What this creates is a shared memory.

And as a result...

Daguerre recalled.

"Remember me, brother?"

"Well, I'm awake now."

Well, that's good to know.

Fen's smile deepens.

Then, he held out his hand to his brother Daguerre, in a gesture of affection.

His hands were clenched tightly...

"Well, it's time to fight. Let's show the world the might of our army of giant gods!

"Of course. That's what I'm talking about!"

Daguerre gave the big order, and Fen smiled happily.

The giant demon king who guarded the Tentong Pavilion as one of the "Eight Star Demon Kings" is no longer with us.

The evil gods of ancient times have returned.






*






The warriors of the giant race were summoned by Daguerre's great command.

The Titan Corps is renamed the "Binding Chain Titan Corps". Then, they began to march into the barren desert to recreate the violence of ancient times.

It was not an orderly movement at all.

Each of them had their own weapons in their hands and were acting according to the orders of the king, Daguerre. Therefore, without any preparation time, they were able to complete their collective actions with a speed that made a mockery of the military organization.

Even Glass Sword, who had been cutting with Leon, was no exception.

"Hmm, it seems that the reason for hostility has disappeared. From now on, we'll be your friends in arms.

As soon as he said that to Leon, Glassord also left the scene.

Leon, unfazed by this, dealt with it. Leon was unfazed by this, because that was the way it was going to be if Feng won.

Ultima felt like crying when she saw that.

You're kidding, right?　It doesn't matter how strong I've become, that's still a bit harsh. ......"

It's tempting to complain about it.

After all, the number of allies has decreased and the number of enemies has increased.

This was exactly the kind of strategy that Rimuru was aiming for, and the enemy was trying to use it.

Fortunately, Daguerre, who was now the enemy, ignored Ultima and the others and started to march.

No, I shouldn't take that as a good thing, but if they had targeted me now, I would have been defeated, so I can only consider myself lucky.

But still, the situation was bad.

Veyron, who had been fighting an even battle with Dino, could not hide his impatience at this.

Ultima-sama, what should we do?　We're running out of time, and I think it's best to start all over again.

I was not afraid of Ultima's intuition, and I even told her so.

Ultima was silent, not complaining about this.

I'm pondering.

"Hey, you're getting stronger, that's for sure. I'll give you that. I'll admit that, but with Daguerre joining us, you don't stand a chance, do you?"

"Yes, yes. You should just admit defeat and leave to the demon world. If you do, we won't be able to chase you and we'll call it a draw!

Galusha and Pico, who had been completely outclassed, were coming to life here.

Ultima, as well as Pico and Galasha, had been fighting without using their powers. As a result, they had suffered the humiliation of being outnumbered by two to one, but here they were. Regardless of his position, he felt happy.

I'm sure you're aware of that. ...... But if I retreat here, I won't be able to face Rimuru. ......

Ultima was getting grumpier and grumpier.

In this case, I'm in the mood to get serious and go on a rampage, not to win or not to win.

I had been told by Rimuru that Dino and the others were only under Michael's control. So, he was trying to neutralize them without really trying.

But the question is, if I get serious here, will I be able to defeat all the enemies in this place?

If the condition is life or death, the odds of winning will increase.

But even so, Ultima thought, it could not be said with certainty.

Leon, Dino, Pico, and Galasha.

Of the four, Dino was probably the most troublesome.

And perhaps it was no surprise that a serious Leon and Ultima would win either.

In other words, there is no chance of winning.

Ultima had not thrown a tantrum and had remained silent because Veyron had been right.

He wondered what to do now, but the situation did not allow for it.

So Ultima made up her mind.

"I trust you, Master Rimuru!　I'm sure he'll be here soon, so we'll keep him busy until then. No objections, Veyron?"

"Yes, sir!"

And so the plan was set...

"Kuhuhuhuhu, you've made the right choice. I commend you, Ultima."

The long-awaited reinforcements arrived in time.






◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇






With Diablo and Souei in tow, I headed for Damargania, the "Holy Void.

He made a "spatial transfer" to the point where Zonda was, joined her, and then quickly rushed to Ultima and the others.

The scene I saw on the way there was horrific.

The giants gathered in a disorderly fashion, and before long, they took on the appearance of a disciplined army.

At the head of the group was Daguerre, but he seemed to be a different person than the one I knew.

Our eyes met for a moment, and he grinned and was horrified.

Honestly, I felt like I was in trouble.

I wondered what I should do, but I didn't need to worry about it, there was only one answer.

Now was not the time to be dealing with Daguerre. I contacted the relevant authorities with a "thought transfer" and promptly left the scene.


And now, I've just met up with Ultima and the others.

I had brought Diablo and Souei with me. With the addition of Ultima, Veyron, and Zonda, who were the original members of the team, we now had a force of six.

And the four opponents are Leon, Dino, Pico, and Galasha. If we can bring Leon back to his senses as planned, our victory will be unassailable.

"What, Rimuru's here too?

"That's right, Dino. But hey, we'll deal with you later!"

As I replied, I focused my attention on Leon.

Leon also seems to be aware of my intentions. The fact that he shows no signs of defying me is proof that Mikael's control is not at the level of brainwashing.

However, it would be impossible for anyone to make a person with a will strong enough to acquire the ultimate ability to sincerely swear allegiance just by the power of authority. It was a fake, if there was one, and the current situation suggested that it would only restrict Michael from acting against his will.

So I decided to take care of the situation.

As I declared, Dino is an afterthought, because Leon.

"Leon, prepare yourself!　Devour the imaginary space..."

and launched a big move from the first move.

He guided Leon to the astral world in the "imaginary space" under the control of the ultimate ability, "Imaginary God". And then, immediately, Dr. Ciel performed a forced "ability modification" on him.

This will make Leon...

"Well, I guess that's the plan, but I don't want to have to do it again."

And, well, it was a safe recovery.

Thus, Leon returned as a friend.

The next target was a languid Dino.

This one, on the other hand, had no motivation to begin with, so the resistance would be small.

I put it off, thinking that I could easily come to my senses, but I thought I'd just finish it all at once - but apparently that was a naive idea.

There was a strong sense of urgency in the air.

This is the kind of oppressive feeling you get when a dragon species gets serious.

At the same time, Souei, who had been in constant communication with the control room, reported.

"Master Rimuru, the area around this place, the Sacred Void of Damargania, has been quarantined by an unbreakable 'ward'.

It's confirmed.

The enemy boss appeared.

"Kuhuhuhuhu, we've been licked by the fact that you're coming alone."

As Diablo smiled, he saw a figure standing leisurely in front of him.

It's Mikael, the man who took over Rudra, who looks a lot like Masayuki.

I got Leon back.

I don't care. Leon's authority, the King of Purity, is in my hands, so he himself is merely bait.

"Bait ......?"


As I thought, it's the "Ote-biwari". It seems that you were thinking of the same move as us.


Let's see, ...... is for the king's wheel!

Then, in this case...


The bait, Leon, is the flying car, and the real deal is...


You're Masayuki!


...... is the correct answer.


I've been hit.

So you put Leon in front of me as a flying car and made me weigh him against Masayuki as a king. And I was caught in the middle.

In other words, Mikael's plan had been accomplished when he lured me to this place.

I understood that Masayuki was important, but I didn't expect her to be so particular. Nevertheless, if I'm not sealed in here, Michael's plan should fail .......

It's a little early to feel like you've won, don't you think?"

Is that so?　I don't think you'll have a chance once I get there."

What confidence.

Even though Dino and the others are still the enemy, I can free them from my control. Knowing that, I'm afraid that you have such a strong attitude.

Or do you have some other winning strategy in mind?

You look like you're wondering if I have a plan. Don't worry. You are insignificant to me. I went along with Feldway because he was a worrier, but I should have done this from the beginning."

The moment I finished listening to Mikhail's words, Diablo suddenly collapsed.

As a matter of course, I was alerted by the "magic detection", so it was certainly not a surprise attack or something as simple as that.

In the first place, I've never seen Diablo fall.

I wanted to believe that he wasn't dead, but I was worried that he hadn't moved a muscle.

"Hey..."

And just as Souei was about to run over to him, Souei himself collapsed on the spot.

What?

I don't know what that means.

Faced with a complete anomaly, Leon readied his sword - and collapsed.

Are you kidding me?

I have no idea what's going on.

I was not the only one who was surprised, Dino and the others were too. In other words, the only person who knows what's going on here is Mikael, who seems to be the one attacking.

What the hell is going on here?


No way. ......


You don't think so, do you?

In other words, even you don't understand, Ciel.

It's not a bad idea.

We don't know what's going on, and it seems impossible to escape.

However, the option of abandoning Diablo and Souei and running away was not provided from the beginning. And then there's Leon.

Ultima, take those lying there and get away from here."

"But what?"

"Forget it. I've got an idea!"

I don't have any, though.

"Kuh-uh-uh. Please wait, Master Rimuru. I can still fight."

Oh, I knew Diablo was safe.

Hmm, I figured you weren't dead from the feel of it, but I guess I should have left no stone unturned."

Mikhail's composure did not falter as he saw Diablo get up. He seemed to have absolute confidence that he could defeat him again and again.

I thought.

This is seriously tasteless, I thought.

Okay, Diablo. Stand down. Take Leon over there and get the hell out of here."

"But!"

"That's an order. There's no way you can win, so you'd better run."

As I said this, I pulled out my sword and readied it.

Since Mikhail's target was me, I knew he wouldn't let me go anyway. That's why it's a good idea to use myself as bait and let the others escape.

Diablo, of course, understands this. Still, he was quite conflicted, but the word "order" seemed to have worked. He split up with Ultima and the others and retrieved Souei and Leon. Then they retreated.

Hmm, I thought I was interrupting something?"

I'm not interested in small fry.

Wow, you're lucky Diablo didn't hear that.

You know, you're totally on my kill list for spouting that line.

He's vindictive, and he'll get it done. That's what makes him such a badass.

But still, it's one against four if I'm the only one left.

Mikhail alone is hopeless, but this one is dead.

Well, worst of all, I think I can revive it because Verdra is here, but it sucks to feel like I actually have to try.

Is that resurrected me really the me of today?　That's why I don't want Verdra to die. That's why I don't like the idea of Verdra dying. ......

As I was thinking about it, Mikael made a move.

Dino, I'll take care of this, and you can all go home.

Oh, thankfully, he seemed to want to have a one-on-one duel. Well, maybe they found out that I was planning to turn Dino and the others over if I had the chance, but I knew the odds of that succeeding were slim, so it was definitely not a bad deal for me.

Oh, you sure?"

I don't care. If you have complete control of your mind, you can't move flexibly, and in your current state, you're cutting corners, aren't you?　I can't use a pawn like that."

Oh, I see. He knew that Dino and Leon weren't really following him.

So, does that mean that Mikael has completely gotten the best of me this time?


《......》


No, it's fine.

Even you make mistakes, don't you, Ciel?


No. This is also a plan.


Again, I have to be very sore loser.

I was also troubled by Ciel's competitive nature.

And well, so much for the light talk, I guess I'll do my best to make a bad move.

When the loss was confirmed, I felt much better.

I didn't want to be seen looking bad, but now that Diablo and the others were gone, I was fine.

Now it's just a matter of trying.

With determination, I observed Mikhail. Then, I could sense that the presence he was emitting was more swollen than when we had met before.

A few times more than me?


I'm not in the labyrinth, so I can't accurately measure it, but I'm pretty sure it's over 100 million.


You can't win that!

A difference of more than 10 times was too much to ask.


No, it's fine. It's the power output that's important, so too much energy alone won't decide the game.


The key, they say, is guts. Is it guts?

Mr. Ciel was too resigned to give up, but he had a point.

If you give up before the fight, you have no chance of winning, but if you try, you might be able to get by.

The problem, however, was the mysterious attack of Mikael, who had defeated even Diablo.

I'm not sure what he did, but I had a feeling of déjà vu.

Yes, that was...


Yes, it was a familiar phenomenon. I'm almost ready to understand that feeling .........


Oh, Ciel, you're still so reliable. So, did you already expect Mikael to launch that attack?


No, sir. I completely miscalculated on that point.


Oh, I see.

Well, I don't have a choice, do I?

It's impossible to perfectly predict the enemy's moves, and we can use this opportunity to uncover the mystery and lead to the next victory.

If you think about it that way, this defeat - well, we haven't lost yet.

I'm not sure if I'm really going to make a comeback, so let's just do our best to keep our feet on the ground here.

While I was thinking about this, Dino and the others left, too.

The only ones left in this place are me and Mikael.

Here, in the great hall of the Tentongkaku, the battle between Mikael and I was about to begin.






◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇






After seeing Rimuru off, Hinata tried to grasp the current situation.

The Capitol, where the World Conference was being held, also had conference rooms and guest rooms on other floors. He rented one of these rooms as a temporary command center and began to compile the reports from his subordinates.

Then, as he took stock of the situation, he let out a sigh, his head hurting.

What the hell is going on here? ......

I couldn't help but mutter to myself.

The Capitol is well guarded to protect the safety of the dignitaries from various countries. Not only the Holy Knights, but also knights from various countries and temporarily commissioned adventurers are on guard.

If the Capitol was dropped, the chain of command would be disrupted, so they had the evacuees be received elsewhere.

The main hall of the Holy Church in the Kingdom of Ingrassia was also open to receive refugees, and not only that, there were plenty of places of refuge prepared in various parts of the royal capital.

The reason for this was that they had always been prepared for the "Heavenly Demon War", an angelic attack that is said to occur every 500 years or so.

This is not only the case in the Kingdom of Ingrassia, but similar facilities have been set up in other western countries. They had prepared shelters for the residents in underground bunkers and caves in the nearby mountainsides. This was also a reason why the thorough evacuation guidance, which was also on the agenda this time, could be adequately addressed.

With regard to the current terrorist acts in the capital, we have made sure to reduce the human casualties by evacuating the residents to such facilities. The purpose of this was to prevent any major confusion from occurring and to prepare an environment where we could concentrate on dealing with the enemy.

Currently, the results of the daily training had been demonstrated and people were being successfully guided. The evacuation was complete and the people who had escaped were calm.

But that's not the end of the problem.

This time it was not a natural disaster, but the people who caused the disturbance.

According to the report, explosions were coming from various parts of the royal capital, and they were developing into fires. And the cause of the fires were said to be demons that were equivalent to Class A or higher.

The Holy Knights had been mobilized for this event, as it was a gathering of important people from various countries. Fortunately, the "holy knights" who were on guard duty were able to handle the situation, but the situation was not good.

Hinata was disgusted, but her position did not allow her to even hint at her feelings. It would only aggravate the anxiety of her subordinates and create more unnecessary work.

Hinata also understood that she should not get emotional in front of the refugees.

It was a problem to further upset people who were already worried.

That's why Hinata doesn't hesitate.

The only thing Hinata could do now was to suppress the anxiety of the refugees as much as possible and prevent chaos.

Fortunately, the facilities are comfortable and we have a stockpile of food.

At any rate, the right thing to do now was to deal with the enemy so as not to cause anxiety to the refugees.

I'll leave this to you. Make sure each shelter has at least one holy knight. Have the Temple Knights help out as well."

"Ha!" "Ha!" "Ha!"

The enemy is not only external.

The displaced people could also turn into a mob.

We're still calm now, but we don't know what will happen if we take the time to eliminate the enemy.

Some were confused with fear, others were screaming and flailing from anxiety. It was expected that the number of such people would increase as time went on.

This all depends on the future situation, but in the worst case scenario, it may be necessary to devote troops to suppressing the riots as well.

Thinking about this, Hinata swallowed a melancholy sigh.


A long time had passed since the explosion.

Here, we finally get a full view of the enemy.

A riot on death row?

"Yes. Moreover, the enemy has released Prince Elric, who was under house arrest in the north tower of the castle, and has made him their flagship!

"Prince Elric... yes, that man had no remorse at all."

Elric was in the process of being re-educated because of his blunder at the council meeting. He was on the verge of being stripped of his right to inherit the throne, but as a result of an agreement between Rimuru and King Aegir of Ingrassia, who did not want to make a mess of things, it was said that he had only been used and his crime was reduced to first degree.

Still, it's a disgrace to the royal family, so for the past year I've been under house arrest in the north tower of the castle as a house arrest ...... and it seems to have fallen into the hands of the enemy.

What's more troubling is that they seem to be voluntarily cooperating with the enemy.

Not only that, but Elric and the others were accusing Hinata by name.

"My beloved people!　I have been deceived by a witch!　She has framed me and ruined my position in the Council. She has framed me and ruined my position on the council, and she has even murdered my father to bring chaos and misery to this land. Do not be deceived!　He is trying to take away your freedom under the pretext of evacuating you!　I believe that my dear and wise people will understand whose words are right!

I heard that Prince Elric himself was making a speech in the city's main square.

Are you sure?"

I checked with my own ears.

What's the proof?

"You cannot enter the Royal Castle at this time. We are trying to confirm this via the Luminous Congregation, but it seems to be quite confusing. ......"

"So there's a good chance that King Aegir has been murdered. Oh my God, that sucks. ......"

It was a headache.

Even though it was expected that there would be an agitated mob, I didn't expect that someone would make the worst choice at the worst time.

To make matters worse, it is the royal family of the Kingdom of Ingrassia that is causing Hinata and the others to suffer.

Prince Elric had caused problems, but the details had not been made public. This had been a disaster, and had complicated the situation.

They are using their position as royalty to the fullest to mobilize the power of the state.

Even Hinata did not expect that the emergency would disrupt the cooperation between the parties.

Now, what can I do?"

As Hinata pondered this, a beautiful white-haired woman in a military uniform appeared in front of her.

Leaning back on the sofa as gracefully as if she were the master of this room, the beautiful woman, Testarossa, opened her mouth.

"It's corroborated. Moss confirmed with his own eyes that Aegir had been killed."

"So, the top brass in this country is unreliable. All hell has broken loose, hasn't it?"

Testarossa nodded with a laugh, saying that the castle was in a state of chaos.

"Yeah. There's a lot of traffic left and right, and the chain of command is all messed up.

Hinata nodded, "I guess so.

"Well, I've ordered Gadrela to guard the chamber, so the dignitaries will be safe.

Testarossa gave him his seal of approval, saying that he could at least be trusted to buy some time. This was a very high evaluation, and Gadra was surprisingly recognized.

That should take your mind off things."

Testarossa and Hinata nodded at each other.

But it was a tricky one.

Not only was there an unidentified enemy, but there was even someone who wanted to harm Hinata.

He seemed to be denouncing Hinata by name as a witch who misled people, but it was difficult to deny this.

If they were just ordinary people, it wouldn't be a problem. If it was at least a nobleman, he could be crushed by the official power of the Luminous Order.

But the other party is the royalty of this country.

The biggest problem would be the high popularity of Prince Elric among the people.

Prince Elric, a beautiful and kind man in appearance, is very popular among women. Regardless of his abilities, he was popular with the people because of his good-natured exterior.

The people don't even know or care about the blunder at the council meeting.

Although Hinata was well known, she was shunned for her cold-heartedness. In terms of popularity, she was not far behind Prince Elric.

Incidentally, Hinata herself is not aware of the fact that she has gained a great deal of support from some people with certain tastes. They are a group of gentlemen who have the common sense to know that it would be the end of the world if they knew.

Regardless of that, the issue now is about Prince Elric.

His men were looking at Hinata anxiously.

That's probably true.

The prince of this country is loudly accusing Hinata of causing people's anxiety.

She was a kingslayer, a witch enchanted by a demon king, a person who leads people to ruin, and so on and so forth.

(Then again, I didn't expect ...... to be this much of an idiot. ......)

Inwardly, Hinata cursed herself for being so careless.

I couldn't see that Prince Elric was this stupid.

Hinata did not expect that he would go to such horrible lengths to kill his father and usurp the throne.

At that moment, there was a knock at the door and a knight entered the room.

It was Arnaud Baumann, one of Hinata's trusted subordinates and the captain of the Holy Knights.

I'm sure you're not the only one. And there are dozens of knights who were supposed to have been captured as his accomplices that have also been confirmed.

Arnaud reported as soon as he entered the room.

Then it must have been Rainer who murdered the king.

I'm sure of it.

He's been framed for the crime, but he won't have a chance to explain himself in court.

Hinata let out a sigh and thought about it.

You mean that son of a bitch, Rainer? Don't you dare resent me for letting Hinata-sama beat you at the council table!"

Fritz, one of the captains who was waiting in the room, complained indignantly.

According to Arnaud's explanation, Rainer had been intimidated by Hinata at the council meeting and had made the mistake of becoming incontinent, and he really wanted to clear his name.

In order to do so, he is planning to defeat Hinata in public and clear his name.

It was so ridiculous that the crime was committed out of a personal grudge.

However, the roots of the problem run deep.

Reiner took forceful measures to make up for his blunder. That was the common understanding of everyone, but there was no way to prove it.

It seemed that everything had been set up and the evidence had been destroyed.

They could ask other countries' representatives to testify, but that would only be possible in normal times. The people would not believe anything Hinata and the others had to say now.

The abominable thing is that Prince Elric is very popular in this country.

It was clear as day which side the people would believe.

Hinata-sama has never had a good reputation. ......

Fritz said lightly, and Arnaud made a small gesture of agreement.

Hinata glared at them and spoke her thoughts as if to change the subject.

We're on the back foot, aren't we?

But I didn't think he would kill his own father, the king. You seem to be trying to pin the blame on Hinata-sama, but you are being reckless.

Hinata murmured, and Arnaud echoed her words.

The purpose of Prince Elric and Reiner is obvious. They intend to take advantage of this chaos and pretend that all their blunders and sins have never happened.

Rather than taking revenge on Hinata for that incident, he guessed that this was meant to be a check on other countries.

He thought that by defeating Hinata, who was known as the strongest person in the western world, he would be able to shut down the protests from other countries.

But I don't understand. I don't think this Rainer guy was good enough to assassinate the king.

From Hinata's point of view, Ryner was not weak, but he was not strong either; he was the equivalent of an A-ranked adventurer.

A country as large as Ingrassia would have several other knights who could rival Rainer. In addition, the magic inquisitor who was present at the council meeting at that time should have been able to control Rainer enough.

How this tragedy had succeeded was more of a mystery to me.

The answer comes from Cardinal Nikolaus, who visits Hinata.

It seems that the magical inquisitors have all been killed. We had information that they had been conducting some dubious experiments in the basement of this place, but it seems that the experimenters have gone out of control."

"Nicolaus."

I've come with a message from Luminous, and I've been checking on him while I'm here.

Nikolaus replied that he was as capable as ever.

He was like a loyal dog who would do anything to be praised by Hinata.

He has a merciless personality toward everyone except Hinata, but he is also very good at mending the surface. He maintains a mild-mannered expression and is well-liked by his followers.

However, for those who knew his true nature, they wanted to avoid getting involved with him as much as possible. In fact, Arnaud and Fritz had become so small that they avoided making eye contact with Nikolaus.

Ignoring the outside world, Nikolaus started to make tea. He is really a diligent man when it comes to earning points in this kind of situation.

Testarossa's portion was prepared as well, and he looked satisfied as he took a sip of it. This was a very high score, and proof that Nikolaus was no ordinary person.

Hinata also sipped her tea and collected her thoughts.

What if, rather than taking advantage of the chaos, even this ruckus is what Elric and the others want?"

"What?　But it's a monster that's running rampant in the city?"

That's the first thing that's strange. I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm sure the strength of the monster is also horseshit to begin with.

The monster that had been reported had appeared not as one, but several at the same time.

It seems that they are running rampant all over the capital, but their purpose is unknown. It was said that they were just going around destroying anything they could find.

In addition, it seems to have "super speed regeneration", which means that the damage is repaired immediately.

Its fighting ability is more than that of a holy knight. It was estimated to be equivalent to a calamity class or calamity class, but fortunately it seemed to have low intelligence, and now they were preparing decoys to minimize the damage.

He had judged that it would be dangerous to deal with them individually and had ordered them to stay behind for now. They had planned to discuss how to deal with them, and in the worst case, Hinata was going to go into battle, but now a problem had arisen and they had to worry about it.

Testarossa joins in on this conversation.

In addition, it seems that several of my men have been defeated. I was under strict orders to retreat before they died, so I didn't get much information, but..."

And then I'll disclose that information.

Testarossa's subordinates are the top demon knights. All of them have an existence value of more than 100,000, and they are all A-grade strong.

It is no wonder that the magic inquisitors were unable to stand up to such a high ranking demon knight who acted with several people and had to choose to retreat.

Apparently, you've incarnated an angel into your experiment.

What did you say?

The ones who failed to incarnate and are running amok are the monsters that are running rampant right now. And the ones who still have their ego intact..."

Testarossa was convinced that the enemy who had defeated the higher demon knight - was the handiwork of Michael.

After listening to Testarossa's explanation, Hinata tapped her fingers on the desk.

The two remaining Holy Knight captains in this room are Arnaud and Fritz.

Leonard, the deputy commander, is in charge in the field, with Bacchus and Ritis in tow.

Thanks to the training in the labyrinth, even the common holy knights who are not captains have grown to be powerful one-hit wonders. In addition, if you are a captain, you are strong enough to defeat an opponent equivalent to Clayman by yourself.

However, when it came to the experimental body of the Magical Inquisitor fused with the power of angels, it was dangerous to deal with it head-on.

In addition, with Mikael's shadow flickering in the background as Rimuru's adversary, he decides that he should not mess with him carelessly.

Nikolaus, you have a message from Luminous, right?"

It was. They say it's not an urgent problem, but they can't send reinforcements."

Which means you have other enemies.

Luminous would not abandon Hinata.

Therefore, the fact that reinforcements cannot be sent means that there are likely other threats lurking in the area.

If that's the case, we'll have to defend the security of King's Landing with only the forces we have at our disposal...

That's harsh.

This was the conclusion that Hinata had drawn.

I'm not sure what to make of it, but I think it's a good idea. Moreover, the trouble is that the monster has taken in the power of the angels and has become a light attribute. The holy cleansing wards that are effective against normal demons will not work at all.

"Well, what do we do now?　All the must-win tactics won't work, though."

"Yeah. I don't care if it's just the monsters, but Reiner and the others are there too."

The liner, it's probably a success.

Testarossa said something, but only Hinata and Nikolaus understood what she meant.

Um, what do you mean?"

Arnaud asks fearfully.

I'd tell you to think for yourself, but we're running out of time. If Reiner was also on death row, is it any wonder that he was experimented on?"

"Ah!"

"Okay, so it's possible that they're taking in angelic powers ......."

Arnaud and Fritz understood, and their faces paled at the same time.

It's not a possibility," said Testarossa to them. Think of it as a definite thing," Testarossa told them ruthlessly.






*






In that case, it would be impossible for the Holy Knights to deal with it alone. Inevitably, cooperation with Testarossa's forces will be important.

So what are we going to do about it?"

When Testarossa asked this question, Hinata answered without hesitation.

I'm sure that's what they want, but we'll have to go to them for an explanation.

Prince Elric claimed that Hinata was the servant of the Kingslayer. There was no reason for Hinata to do such a thing, and since she had a perfect alibi for having participated in the World Conference, it was impossible for her claim to be accepted.

But that's only if it's normal.

The current royal capital was in turmoil.

The people of Ingrassia, accustomed to a world of peace and tranquility, are in the midst of a catastrophe that seems to have come out of the blue.

If Hinata were to be killed here, all the claims of the real killer would be confirmed.

If that's the case, running away is one way to go.

Fortunately, the Church of the Holy Spirit in the capital has a transference camp, and there is also transference magic in the suburbs. Fortunately, the Church of the Holy Spirit in the capital has a transference camp, and if we pass through to the outskirts, we can use transference magic. As long as Hinata-sama is safe, you can explain yourself as much as you want later, can't you?

This was Cardinal Nikolaus' statement, and Hinata agreed that it made sense.

But he couldn't just nod.

No, we can't. We can escape if it's just us, but it's impossible to take out the attendees of the conference, right?　Once they're taken hostage, there's nothing we can do."

They were all convinced that this was the case.

You're right. Besides, let's not forget that there is another real enemy. What will happen if the key people in the country are killed when the angelic army is about to attack?"

Nikolaus frowned when he heard this.

"Oh, I see. If that were to happen, the cooperation between the countries would be torn to shreds. At the very least, no country will be able to trust the Kingdom of Ingrassia."

Well, if that happens, I won't be able to fight angels.

Fritz was also convinced, muttering to himself with a bitter expression.

The only way to conclude is to go out like Hinata said.

Based on her beliefs, Hinata set out to do what she could now.

I don't think that I want to save everyone, but if there is someone in front of me that I can save, I will reach out to them, because that is how Hinata lives.

Hinata knew very well that this would eventually lead to trust in them.

"Well, it looks like you've convinced me. Now, let's decide on our roles.

Hinata said and declared that she would take care of Rainer.

Testarossa nodded at this.

I'll go with you. So, about getting rid of those monsters..."

Without waiting for Testarossa's words, Arnaud and Fritz, who were standing upright, shouted.

"I don't need to trouble you, Mister Testarossa. We'll take care of that!"

"If it's a monster with no ego and lacks intelligence, there's a way to fight it. The light attribute is a bit tricky, but we've been trained in the labyrinth, so we'll show you the results!

Hinata looked at them with a frown.

(Why are these two so conscious of Mister Testarossa?)

He was dismayed that she wanted to look good in front of a beautiful woman.

But the truth is different.

These two are truly frightened of Testarossa.

If he couldn't play an active role here, he would be branded as useless. If that happens, it will be unclear what will happen to the training in the labyrinth in the future.

Besides, there were many sympathizers of Testarossa, not only in the labyrinth. There were also followers in the legislature, so there was even a danger that if they were not careful, they might lose their power to speak out in the future.

This was the reason why Testarossa's influence was increasing, but Hinata had lost interest in politics and had no idea that this was happening.

As for Testarossa, this is a very important phase of his life. Despite being ordered by Limuru to make the World Conference a success, she has allowed the enemy to enter.

On top of that, he was responsible for not being able to stop the destruction in King's Landing.

It is no excuse to say that the priority was human life.

Behind her smile, Testarossa was burning with rage.

That's why I approve the advice of Arnaud and the others.

I'll do you a favor, then. I'll lend you some of my men, and you can incorporate them into your unit."

I told him so and went to help Arnaud and the others.

All of this is a preparation for our own actions.

He left the command to Arnaud and the others and gave them the task of restoring security to the capital. On top of that, he himself was going to strike the mastermind.

This is how the roles are determined.

"Well, let's go then. We have to give the people who acted foolishly in this emergency a well-deserved punishment.

Hinata told him coldly.

He intends to get rid of Reiner here to clear his own name.

Then we must capture Elric and make him confess to his crimes.

But...

"Well, we can do whatever we want with the evidence. Once we've taken out all the underlings, we'll have the right story in the hands of the winner."

That's what Testarossa said.

It is a declaration that we will do exactly what the enemy is trying to do.

As the devil does not care about ethics, he thinks that as long as he wins, anything is possible. It was a very Testarossa-like argument.

So Hinata and the others went to the stage where the enemy was waiting for them, knowing that it was a trap.






*






When I walked out of the Capitol, I found it in a terrible state.

The royal castle, which can be seen in the center of the city, has partially collapsed, spoiling its once beautiful appearance.

The aristocratic district, where the Capitol and the branch of the Holy Church are located, is relatively better, but the area around the downtown area facing the main street of the city was on fire.

We had to evacuate first, but there's a lot of cleanup to do.

The real fighting is still to come, and there will be more damage. With the loss of the king and his successor like that, it will take time for Ingrassia to recover.

Nikolaus calmly responded to Hinata's murmur.

It was a cold reaction, unbecoming of a priest. But that was Nikolaus' normal behavior.

For Nikolaus, Hinata was the only priority, and he did not care about anything else. It was because he wanted to be of service to Hinata that he had risen to the position of Cardinal, the highest position after the Pope.

That's why I'm still accompanying him, despite the danger.

By the way, there are five of us now.

Hinata, Testarossa, and Cardinal Nikolaus, who had come with Hinata out of concern for her. These three were joined by Moss and Cien, who had been summoned to join them.

As we head for the desired location, we plan our strategy.

"Moss, you don't have to fight, just go into 'spotting mode' and prepare for a surprise attack."

"Yes, sir!"

Moss was a yes man.

I don't say anything else, and I follow Testarossa.

Even so, he sometimes says unnecessary things that get him into trouble, but he has been Testarossa's second-in-command for a long time, so he knows how to take care of himself.

This Moss's "enemy search mode" was a kind of so-called "ward". It disperses its own fragmented body into a hemisphere of one kilometer in diameter. This makes it possible to react immediately to a surprise attack from 500 meters away.

At first glance, it may not seem much different from "universal sensing," but it is not. The speed of information transmission is incomparably faster, and Moss's own analytical abilities are also added to enable him to deal with enemy attacks.

In addition, for Testarossa, who can increase her perception speed by a million times through her powers, 500 meters is a perfect distance. In the event that it is an attack at the speed of light, under the influence of Moss's search mode, there is a margin of more than one second before it hits the target, so it is possible to deal with it.

Of course, it can't move at the speed of light, and it only extends the experience time, but Testarossa is still able to do something.

Moss's "enemy spotting mode" seemed to be perfect, but it had only one drawback.

It's...

The most dangerous point is that Moss is the one who will receive the first blow.

(I bet you wouldn't be worried about me getting damaged in that surprise attack, would you? ......)

He was obedient, but inwardly he was a whining Moss.

With a glance at Moss's authority, Hinata saw the nature of it.

"So they're still on the lookout for surprise attacks. So you're saying that what they're screaming about is a decoy?"

Testarossa smiles as he points this out.

"That's true. We can narrow down the enemy's objective when they target this meeting in the first place."

The biggest possibility is that he is the emperor of the empire. The biggest possibility is Masayuki, the hero who became the emperor of the empire?"

When Hinata answered without any worries, Testarossa's smile deepened.

"As expected, Hinata-dono. That's why Rimuru-sama approves of you.

"I'm flattered. I'm sure it's obvious to everyone."

Not really, but okay."

Testarossa chuckled as she thought of the faces of the people she had conversed with recently. Many of them were not very perceptive, and she was quite stressed out.

People who don't listen to others are the worst. There were many times when we could not reach a consensus because we were expressing our opinions only for our own benefit.

Some of them announced the agreement on their own after the meeting, and I had a bad taste of the hassle of political negotiations.

There were even fools that the contract-oriented demons could not understand.

Testarossa, who has always made sure that those who have done so know their share, has always wished that they would not have to go through the unnecessary trouble.

On that note, the conversation with Hinata was quick and pleasant.

That's exactly what Master Rimuru wants.

I'm sure. There was an incident elsewhere at the same time as this ruckus, and Rimuru was headed there. He must have prepared a reasonably large bait, right?"

Yeah, that's right.

Testarossa nodded.

It had been agreed in advance that Rimuru would go to Leon when he appeared. Testarossa had also been told this, but Hinata had guessed it without knowing it.

Testarossa explained the situation to a certain extent, as if she had guessed that much.

As soon as she heard this, Hinata also pointed out several problems.

It was a really fun conversation to catch up on.

(I've heard you're smart, but I want you as my subordinate. (I've heard you're smart, but I'd like to have you as a subordinate, though I doubt Lord Rimuru would approve.)

Just the fact that he allows himself to be called Rimuru, and Hinata to be called Rimuru, makes it clear that Hinata is a special person. Even more so, when he was dealing with Hinata, he seemed to return to his true self and seemed to be enjoying himself very much.

Knowing Limuru like this, Testarossa had no choice but to give Hinata a glance.

(How enviable indeed. But I guess I'm just plain glad that the woman Lady Rimuru approves of wasn't a fool.)

Since ancient times, there have been countless cases where a country has been turned upside down by a woman who has gained the favor of the king.

On this point, Hinata did not have to worry about that.

In the first place, Rimuru and Hinata were not lovers, so Testarossa was thinking too much, but surprisingly, many people thought that way.

They were the only ones who didn't know.

Anyway, now we're talking about the enemy's objective.

We have to bring the Demon Lord Leon back to his senses and bring him back to our camp. This is the basic tactic.

But of course, it was expected that the enemy would be aware of their aim.

"Feldway was a sharp man, and he would have seen that it was Rimuru-sama who brought Verglind-sama back to his senses. If that's the case..."

From Testarossa's point of view, there was no doubt that Feldway was capable. Although he had many flaws, he was sure that he had a plan to deal with Rimuru.

"I should think that using the Demon Lord Leon as bait to lure out Rimuru is a winning strategy.

Testarossa nodded that he was right.

However, there was no way that Rimuru could not see that.

That deep-seated recklessness must have swallowed even Feldway's plan.

"Lord Rimuru knew this and went to rescue the Demon Lord Leon.

With absolute confidence, Testarossa assured him.

When Hinata heard this, she tilted her head in concern.

"But maybe he thinks he can win if he just summons it. They say that Mikhail has taken in the power of the dragon species, but can Rimuru really win against such a monster?"

Hinata's concern was understandable.

From Testarossa's point of view, it seemed impossible that Rimuru would be defeated. But that was not a question that could be answered at this stage, when she had not even seen the real enemy.

What if Feldway and Mikael are waiting for Limuru where he's headed?

(Well, I still believe that he can do something about it, but...)

We also have Diablo and Souei as guards.

He had to trust that Rimuru would be okay.


If the enemy's goal was Rimuru, Hinata and the others would have nothing to worry about.

I'll trust you to take care of that, but the problem is if you have other objectives.

Targeting the senators seems like a good idea, but it's not.

I agree. There is no great advantage in dividing the Western world now. If they can defeat Rimuru, they won't even bother with a united coalition of nations.

We both agree.

I considered many other possibilities, but I settled on the most likely conclusion that the enemy's target was Masayuki.

"So, where did the Emperor disappear to?"

Hinata asked.

Some time after the disturbance, Masayuki had disappeared from the Capitol.

There were probably guards from the Empire outside the Capitol, and the "Burning Dragon" Vergrind was by Masayuki's side. In fact, it seemed to me that Masayuki was the safest one.

That's why I left it alone, but when the enemy's target is Masayuki, it's a different story.

"Perhaps Master Verglind realized what the enemy wanted and evacuated them.

No, no matter what the enemy's intentions were, they would have prioritized Masayuki's safety. Testarossa knew that was what Vergrind would do.

Then I guess it's safe to assume."

Hinata agreed that at least it would be better than protecting them themselves.

If so, the next thing to think about is the terms of their victory.

If the enemy's target is Masayuki, we are being used as bait, right? Do you think Masayuki will come to our rescue when we are about to be killed?"

Hinata also knew that the boy was a softie, as she had met Masayuki. However, since he had become the emperor, he should put himself first, and he knew that he would be cool-headed about it.

Testarossa agreed with this.

That's what I'm wondering. It's an impossible assumption, but even if we were about to die, I don't think Masayuki-dono would show up to save us.

In this case, it wasn't just a matter of Masayuki herself. Since Verglind is attached to her, he would definitely give priority to Masayuki.

Hinata and Testarossa were in agreement on this view as well.

Therefore, the conclusion is also the same.

"Well, even if the people we're about to deal with only see us as bait, we have no reason to go along with them.

You're right. Let's get rid of all of them and lure out those who are hiding."

After all, winning solves all problems.

Hinata and the others arrived at their destination, having shared the assumption that they would be taken by surprise.






*






Moss had disappeared, and only four people remained.

"Nicolaus, you will stay here. If we are victorious, secure Prince Elric immediately."

Although Hinata did not put it into words, it also meant that she should run away if she was defeated.

Nikolaus is not weak as a person, but he is not strong enough to stand on this battlefield. That was the reason why he gave the order.

"Yes, sir. I wish you the best of luck!"

Even as Nikolaus, he didn't want to be slowed down.

He was willing to use his own life as a shield in case of Hinata's danger, but at that moment he obeyed quietly.

In this way, Hinata and the others were the only three people in the square.

When the group arrived at the square in the royal capital, they were met by a group of fully armed knights.

Even excluding Elric and Rainer, there are nearly twenty people.

"Finally, you're here, I've been waiting so long!"

The one who smirked and spoke up was Rainer, whom Hinata also recognized.

From a cursory observation, I could see that it had been enhanced tremendously.

Hinata guessed from the presence that she could feel that the amount of energy was greater than hers.

(You were right to leave Nikolaus out of this. In a real fight, I definitely wouldn't have time to worry about it.)

If he did, he could get Nikolaus involved.

Hinata was a little relieved, because as a mere human being, Nikolaus would have had no way to survive.

Anyway, he analyzed the enemy's strength while listening to Reiner's words.

(Elric has no supremacy, so it seems he's still a normal human. But the others...)

Elric seemed to have been merely playing the role of a portable shrine, and he looked the same as before. He was a little rough, but I guessed that was because he had been under house arrest.

The others, however, were the problem.

(Unusual presence. I see, you've surpassed even the holy knight of the captaincy. Maybe your power has increased to the point where you can rival me. ......)

Although I can't say for sure just by looking at her, Hinata has the unique skill "Mathematician". I analyzed them and found that they were at least calamity level. Some of them, such as Louie and Roy, were comparable to the calamity level, and with nearly twenty of them, it was going to be a tough fight even for the "saintly" Hinata.

But that's not the biggest problem.

(The liner is crazy. Maybe even more so than me.)

Although not as strong as the Testarossa standing next to her, she could sense a lot of power. This was dangerous, Hinata thought, and she became more alert.

If Testarossa could handle it, it would be the safest choice.

But I can't do that.

This was because there was another man in the room who was extremely dangerous.

"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!　Reiner, we're in luck!　With two such beauties in the house, we won't have to fight!

"No doubt. Vega's brother, I'll take Hinata as promised, but you don't mind, do you?"

"Of course. It's not like I'm going to gain any power by eating a weak woman like that. Well, you can enjoy it in a different way, but unfortunately, it's a strategy right now.

It was Vega, a man who laughed in a vulgar voice.

She sat on the edge of the fountain with her legs spread wide, radiating a hint of evil that she did not hide. Vega's attributes are evil itself, even though he has taken in the light-attribute spiritual life form of an angel.

(I don't think I can do anything about that one. Depending on my ability, I might be able to stick with it, but my chances of winning are probably slim to none.)

Hinata saw through this.

In fact, Vega's existence value was more than ten million, more than ten times that of Hinata. Even though Hinata also had a hidden trick up her sleeve, it seemed unlikely that she would win even if she used it.

If that was the case, then there was no one else but Testarossa to take care of Vega. Inevitably, Hinata's opponent would be Ryner.

"Oh, that's vulgar. I hate fools who don't know their place."

Testarossa smiled bewitchingly and said this as she looked down at Vega.

Hinata's confidence in herself was very encouraging.

"Cheeky girl. I'm the first of the Seven Evil Generals, let me show you what I'm really capable of!"

Very easily, Vega took the challenge.

With this, the battle between Testarossa and Vega was decided.

There was no way to let this trend go.

Hinata asked with a relaxed look on her face.

"So, who's going to be my opponent?　You even got stuck just by staring at me, are you planning to challenge us all?"

That's what he's trying to instigate, to get into a one-on-one fight with Rainer.

If they all came at her, Hinata would have little chance of winning. Even if she and Cien fought together, it would only be a matter of time before they defeated at most ten of them.

However, if he could get rid of Rainer first, he would be able to discourage the remaining enemies from fighting. If that happened, they would not be able to show their full potential, and the chances of winning would be greatly increased.

Incidentally, Hinata thought that Ryner would have no choice but to accept the match if he agitated like this. The reason for this is that there are magical devices in various parts of the royal capital that connect to underground shelters so that you can see what is going on above ground.

The stone statue in the fountain in the main square was one of them, and the conversation between Hinata, Rainer and the others had become transparent to the people of the royal capital.

Elric knew this, which is why he was making his big speech here, and of course Reiner knew this too.

Hinata thought that Ryner would think that if he ran away from the game here, it would be impossible for him to clear his name for the rest of his life.

That prediction was correct.

"Kook, I've been taken advantage of. I was a bit out of sorts that time. I'm going to prove it by beating you here.

Thus, Ryner and Hinata were also able to get into the flow of fighting each other.






*






Hinata drew her sword.

This is a gem that Limuru gave me.

It was not a fine sword of special quality. The quality of the sword had been raised to legendary level due to the improvements that had been made since then and Kurobehere's improved skills.

The name of the sword is Genji Hosho Ken.

Even though it is of the same legendary grade, the quality is lower than that of the Moonlight Fine Sword. However, the Phantom Rainbow Slender Sword is capable of perfectly reproducing the "Seven Color Demise Piercing Strike".

The sword that he had used when he fought Rimuru was capable of completely destroying the mental body on the seventh attack. But with this sword, even the starry astral body could be destroyed.

Needless to say, it was more powerful and stronger than the Gekko's fine sword, so it was even better than the Gekko's fine sword in terms of usability.

Are you ready?"

"You idiot, that's my line!"

And so the battle began.

As usual, Hinata analyzed the enemy's strength and accurately searched for their weak points.

At first glance, Reiner appeared to be a human being, but his essence seemed to have transformed into another creature. The evidence of this was his strange body movement. Apart from walking, he was also moving sideways in a smooth motion. It even kicked the ground and jumped into the air in the same position.

The secret seemed to be hidden in the soles of her shoes, but what was more noticeable was the shoulder area. It was large and raised, and it was obvious that he was hiding something.

Die!

Reiner swung his sword wide and swung down at Hinata. Instead of catching it, Hinata quickly twisted her body to avoid it.

I had a feeling it would be dangerous, but I was right in my response.

(This sword is not just legendary, it's powerful. Yes, it was mythical grade. ......)

It is unclear where and how he got it, but it was a moment that gave us a glimpse of Rainer's power.

In this situation, the difference in weapon performance was no longer a disadvantage. If he slashed at her properly, Hinata's phantom rainbow fine sword might be shattered.

In fact, there was a huge gap between the two existence values.

While Hinata was a saint, she carried the egg of a hero, but it never hatched and was left to Chloe. The power of the "saint" was still intact, but it had an existence value of just over one million.

As a human, he was strong enough. In fact, he was equal to King Gazelle, but he was not far behind Rainer, who was equivalent to two million.

However, that's just the physical side of things.

Hinata had the memory and experience of traveling with Chloe.

Even now, Hinata's pure skills are still alive and well.

There was a huge difference from when he had faced Ryner before, and if you look at it as an overall strength, Hinata was much stronger, even if the difference in weapon performance was a concern.

It was as if Hinata's victory was guaranteed as soon as she could get into a one-on-one situation.

But that was only if Reiner was a knight and had a fair and honest character.

Hinata had misjudged him.

Hinata had assumed that Ryner was of a lowly nature, but he was a coward beyond her imagination.

Hinata was also very cautious and never let her guard down, but there are some people in this world who are even lower than the lowest of the low and are unimaginably stupid.

The liner was exactly that.

I don't know if it's his innate nature or if his nature has been warped by the modifications, and it doesn't matter anymore. The important thing here is that Rainer never intended to fight in single combat from the beginning.

After several rounds of attack and defense, Hinata continued to dodge Ryner's sword. Then, with a split second of timing, she flicked Ryner's sword away from her side as if she were knocking it off.

This convinced him of victory and left an opening for Rainer.

"Well, that's not much to say. If you give up..."

He had done something he didn't need to do: capture Reiner as a traitor and put him on trial.

That was the death of me.

When Reiner fell down, his minions were positioned so that they were standing behind Hinata. And then, as if aiming for that moment, they all attacked him from behind.

Of course, Hinata was also preparing for a surprise attack with her "magic sensing" and was also connected to the "thought transference" with Moss and received a warning.

However, it is the liner that we should be wary of, and we don't have the time to devote our attention to the mundane.

That's why he thought he had no chance of winning if he was outnumbered - he had to accept a certain amount of attacks.

It was an instantaneous event.

"Hinata-dono!"

Before Cien could shout, a large number of light bullets exploded on Hinata. And then Ryner, with a broad smile on his face, struck a blow.

There was no sword in his hand, but his body was also covered by a full body armor of mythical grade. Its shoulders were wide open, and two pairs of thin, hard hands covered in mythical grade armor were sprouting out.

They turned into four spears and pierced Hinata's limbs.

He lost his support and Hinata fell to the ground.

The sword spills out of his hand.

He had lost his grip and could barely stand up.

"Hahaha!　I'm sure you're not the only one who's had it.　It's a good thing you're lying on the ground like that, you cocky bastard!

Reiner laughs loudly in an annoying high-pitched voice.

"You!　Wasn't this supposed to be a fair fight?

Reiner snickered at Cien's faintly exclaimed words.

"Criminals don't have rights. "Criminals don't have human rights, but we're merciful. If they cry and beg for forgiveness, we'll at least consider postponing the date of execution for a little while.

Then Reiner smirked at her. Without waiting for Hinata's reply, he continued to speak his selfish argument.

You'll have to show some gratitude.

It was an uncanny smile that showed through his lowly thoughts.

The same goes for Reiner's men.

"Ha ha ha!　The strongest in the west looks like Yi!"

"I guess this is the end for the undefeated witch."

No, no, we just got too strong. It only looked like a good match because Reiner was playing with us."

And so on.

Whether or not they had always been like that, I don't know. However, it is a fact that they are now inexplicably stupid.

Hinata's figure had become too cruel.

The tattered back of the "Holy Spirit Armor" revealed a bare, burned skin.

And his limbs had been severed so that he could not even move his tendons.

Despite the devastation, Hinata's bare face, wet with sweat, was beautiful. Her eyes never lost their brightness, and Hinata's dignified expression showed that she had not given up yet.

"Now cry and beg for forgiveness, or I'll kill you right now. Or I'll kill you right now, won't I?"

Rainer shouted, his eyes bleeding with madness.

Because of the sight of Hinata crawling on the ground, he was driven by a lecherous pleasure.

By now, Rainer's rational mind had almost jumped.

Hinata was normally beyond his reach, a flower of the highest order. The situation of being able to violate such a high being surpassed all the pleasures Reiner had felt in the past.

No matter how much of a selfish fool Reiner was, he was aware that he was inferior to Hinata.

No, I realized it the moment I confronted it.

No matter how much she surpassed him in strength, she could not overturn the "difference in rank". Hinata's skill with a sword alone was light years ahead of Rainer's.

When he was confronted with this, Rainer almost went crazy with jealousy. That is why he had no hesitation in executing the trap that he had prepared for just in case.

It was not as we had originally planned, but it turned out okay.

(You're also lucky that your face wasn't damaged. (You're also lucky that your face wasn't damaged, so you can enjoy seeing how your beautiful, well-formed face contorts in pain and how you cry!)

Reiner felt his blood boiling and his strength rising. Just the thought of Hinata in such a state filled him with a black joy.

Now that this has happened, Rainer believes that their victory is unassailable. That's why he plans to beat Hinata to the point of submission.

If that happens, there will be another kind of fun waiting for you. ...... I think it would be a shame to kill it here.

Hey!　If you don't hurry up, I'm really gonna kill you.

Rainer declared in a creepy voice.

It was a serious threat.

He wanted to enjoy the pleasure of tormenting Hinata, but Hinata's strength was real.

If his heart was not broken here, he should have at least sliced off a limb.

Reiner is a coward.

So be vigilant and think about what you are doing.

Even if Hinata called her friends now, it would take time for them to arrive. In the first place, it was unlikely that they would be able to gather enough strength to fight against them.

Besides, if you sense such a sign, then you can quickly give the order to attack.

Absolute dominance.

There was no reason to lose.

Hinata did not reply, but kept staring at Rainer.

His eyes told me that he was not defeated yet.

(Damn, you really are a cocky bitch. Then I'll drop a leg or something!)

Reiner irritably raised his sword and swung it down at Hinata...






*






Hinata was in desperate danger, but Testarossa had no time to help her.

He had his hands full with Vega.

He could tell from the look in her eyes that Hinata was not giving up. Then he had to believe in her.

(He's one of the few people who could have driven Rimuru-sama to a draw. I don't think he'll just leave at this point.)

That's when it happens.

Although it was very likely that Rimuru would be furious, Testarossa had not been ordered to protect Hinata.

There were times when he would make a disciplined move, but to Hinata he thought it was none of his business. In fact, it was more likely to hurt Hinata's pride to do something like this, and it might cause Rimuru's displeasure.

Testarossa decided that it was not too late to help Hinata after she had been defeated.

So I didn't hesitate, and now I'm concentrating on Vega.

Vega was tricky.

Vega's magical element was several times greater than Testarossa's, but he thought it would be easy to just kill her. However, it seemed to have been a false idea.

(It's got underground roots, doesn't it? I wonder if it can absorb corpses to make the damage go away?)

It was just as Testarossa had predicted.

Vega had spread his authority throughout the royal city of Ingrassia, capturing and absorbing the corpses of the monsters that were still being defeated.

It didn't increase his strength, but it was a great way to replenish missing parts and replenish his energy. This made Vega practically immortal.

(You're an annoyingly troublesome partner. ......)

That was Testarossa's true feeling.

It might be possible to destroy it by burning down a large area with nuclear bombardment magic. But in order to do that, we needed to get a complete picture of Vega.

That alone would have been troublesome, but even before that, that method was not allowed. As long as we were fighting here in the royal capital of Ingrassia, any action that would lead to the destruction of the city was basically forbidden.

They were allowed to flee, but they were not allowed to do anything to win.

That would make it nearly impossible to kill Vega.

Moreover, it was not a good idea to hunt down Vega. If he did that, there was a high possibility that he would use the people of the royal capital who were fleeing underground as bait to try to regenerate himself.

For now, it's enough to absorb Reiner's subordinates who have turned into monsters. But if he cornered them any further, he expected Vega to resort to any means necessary.

From Testarossa's point of view, it was as if she was being forced to fight a battle that she could not see a way to win.

What makes this situation even more frustrating for me is...

"Hey, what's the matter with you?　You were so excited, but you didn't do much at all!

That was the attitude of the overzealous Vega.

(It's not easy to make me want to kill you from the bottom of my heart, is it? You should be proud of yourself for that.)

Testarossa was inwardly pissed off.

However, it is true that we cannot afford it.

He flicked his flaming whip and toyed with Vega, but his mind was able to see two or three moves ahead. As long as he couldn't get into a deadlock situation, he would have to maintain the stalemate. If he wanted to break the deadlock, he would need some external factor.

The enemy has a hidden force lurking in the background. It seems certain that this is the case, so Testarossa and his team are at a disadvantage in the big picture.

If there was one factor that tipped the scales in favor of Testarossa and the others, it was the presence of Verglind. However, it was unlikely that she would leave Masayuki's escort.

(Probably, Feldway's target is also Masayuki-dono. (Perhaps Feldway's target is also Masayuki-dono, and Verglind-sama is not so naive as to dare to play into the hands of the enemy.)

Of course, Verglind must be aware of Feldway's intentions. If that was the case, Testarossa thought, he would not come as reinforcements.

And at the same time.

They also understand that they are being treated as bait to lure Masayuki out.

This stalemate was a good thing for Feldway and his team.

(It's really frustrating. (It's really frustrating that I know what I'm doing, but I just have to live with the situation. It seems that Karela and Ultima have their hands full, and there are no other executives who can move. (If Zegion were to come along... no, I don't think Lord Rimuru would allow that.)

I knew that my colleagues were also struggling because of the emergency call through the "control room". The "control room" has now declared a state of emergency and has shifted to combat mode.

They were preparing for an enemy invasion, and there was no way that Zegion, the cornerstone of their defense, would move.

Zegion was the only one who could be relied upon among the cadres who could move freely at the moment. The others are not weak, but they do not have the power to overturn any situation.

No, Verdra, a superpower, was also waiting in the wings, but he couldn't make the foolish move of leaving the labyrinth when Michael was after him.

In other words, no reinforcements are coming.

Testarossa had no choice but to conclude that he would have to take care of it himself.

But then something unexpected happens...






*






Reiner swung his sword at Hinata.

At that moment...

Squeak!　A clear tone of "squeak!" was emitted and caught by someone's sword.

No, it wasn't a sword.

The beautiful woman held in her hand a feather fan that did not look like a weapon at all.

The name of the beautiful woman whose shining blue hair is dominating the scene is the "Burning Dragon" Vergrind.

"Hinata, right?　My brother said that he proved that the skills he had developed and improved could reach the dragon species, didn't he?　Isn't that right, Testarossa?

If that's true, I won't allow myself to be defeated at this point..." Verglind told him.

He ignored Reiner and turned his gaze to Testarossa.

"Indeed, Mr. Verglind. I mean, I wasn't expecting you to come."

I didn't mean to interfere. I didn't mean to interfere either, but Masayuki did.

Verglind turned to Masayuki with compassionate eyes.

The scene that followed...

Are you okay, Hinata-san?

"Oh..."

It was Masayuki rubbing Hinata's breasts.


The person involved, Masayuki, seemed to be in a dignified state, but inside he was in a state of panic.

(Yes, what the hell is going on with ......)

The suddenness of the event made Masayuki instantly lose all sense of reality.

(Or rather, the feel of this right hand: ......)

A soft, muffled feeling coming from the palm of his right hand. It was the moment when Masayuki's brain began to understand what it was.

This was, in other words, the reason why Masayuki had been so taken aback by Hinata.

When Masayuki tried to help Hinata up, she tripped over a pebble that had fallen at her feet.

As a result, Masayuki fell down and carefully pushed Hinata down. His right hand touched Hinata's chest, regardless of her intentions.

This is still a lucky break for me.

And more.

Thanks to the close proximity of their lips, Hinata's true face could be seen clearly.

Her eyes were wide open and sparkled like blackish purple crystal. The bridge of her nose was straight, and her lips were full and fresh. Her skin was fine and translucent without any makeup.

(She's so beautiful, isn't she? No wonder Mr. Rimuru can't resist her.)

This is the kind of thinking that makes me want to escape reality.

No wonder.

Hinata's breath tickled his nostrils and the sweet smell made his brain debaucherous.

I was so happy that I might have fainted if I hadn't had the experience of being hugged by Verglind so many times.

It seems like a long time, but it's less than a second.

Masayuki's brain rebooted, thinking that they shouldn't be staring at each other forever.

Hinata's eyes widened in surprise, but Masayuki thought that was probably true.

You can't help but wonder what the hell he's doing.

He was afraid that Hinata would come to her senses. It would be a horrible thing to happen, Masayuki feared.

No, it's not!"

This is different, this is different, Masayuki exclaimed in his mind.

Masayuki paled, but she stood up and tried to make an excuse, but...

(Huh?　Now there's something ......)

Masayuki felt a shock on her back and realized that something had passed over them.

Then I feel a creeping sense of dread.

"Masayuki..."

What I heard belatedly was Verglind's exclamation.

It was not a voice that was angry at Masayuki, but a voice that was sincerely concerned.

What just happened?

In fact, at the very moment when Masayuki collapsed, someone had attacked him.

Only Verglind could have guessed that.

It was an attack that even Testarossa could not detect. In any case, she hurriedly checked her coordination with Moss.

Before he even had a chance to call out, Masayuki accidentally fell and avoided the attack. If he had not stumbled, his life would have been cut short.

A lucky boy indeed.

The man of extraordinary good fortune showed his true colors again this time.

(Whoa!　Maybe I've been targeted with all my might?)

Masayuki, who was late to the party, paled in a different way, but he was lucky that it was all over.

Then Hinata made her move.

It would be extremely dangerous and foolish to stand still in a place where she was targeted. Therefore, Hinata rolled over to hug Masayuki, without saying a word.

Masayuki was touched. The happy feeling of being embraced and the silky, comfortable feeling of Hinata's hair on his cheek. It tickled and smelled so good, he wanted to escape reality. But that was not allowed .......

Or rather, it was not the time.

"Damn, I didn't think ...... you'd be able to avoid my assassination attempt. ......"

The man who showed up, letting out a cry of surprise, was a man in a black costume with pure white wings - Arios.

The unique skill "Murderer," which was the mother of the ultimate grant "King of Punishment," had a power called "Existence Concealment. It is an ability that makes those under its influence unrecognizable until some action is taken.

This allowed him to hide out with Feldway and keep an eye on him.

And now, he had launched a desperate assassination ploy, aiming for the moment when Masayuki had appeared, and had failed spectacularly.

Arios took another stance, but two men stood in front of him.

"Masuyuki's enemies are my enemies."

"Well, there you have it. I won't let you lay a finger on His Majesty."

and Venom and Minute entered the fray.

A little later, Bernie and Jiu also showed up.

"I was charged with protecting His Majesty's person, but I overlooked the assassin. I will deal with this later..."

No, no, no, no!

Bernie and Jiu had been hiding and guarding Masayuki, but they hadn't realized that Arios had been lurking in the area from the start.

This was not the fault of the two of them, but it was definitely a huge blunder.

However, Masayuki denied it in a panic.

If they didn't, the two of them were bound to say something about taking responsibility and committing suicide, or some other fucking hassle.

Anyway, I told them to focus on the enemy for now and decided to leave this matter in the dark. As a result, the four of us stood up to Arios to protect Masayuki.


The battlefield was repartitioned.

Testarossa and Moss increase their vigilance.

Cien is fighting a lone battle against the knights to keep them in check.

Hinata struggles to get up, and Masayuki is confused when he starts to lend his shoulder to her.

In order to protect Masayuki, Venom and the top forces of the Empire come to her aid.

Nikolaus came to call Verglind and Masayuki, or rather, joined them on the way. He was furious at the sight of Hinata's devastation.

And Verglind smiles bewitchingly.

And against...

Reiner is not happy because he is unable to finish off Hinata, whom he has cornered.

Vega smirks, amused by the situation.

Arios was unsuccessful in his attack.

Feldway is displeased with the failure of his plan just after it seemed to have succeeded completely.

And then there were Reiner's subordinates, who were still alive and well.

With the introduction of Masayuki and Verglind into the battlefield, the situation became even more chaotic.






◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇






The residents of the royal capital listened to the broadcast with anxiety.

Anyone who is in the area where the images are shown is glued to the screen watching.

Although Reiner's words were uncomfortable, there was no room for doubt when Prince Elric was on their side.

However, as the battle rages on, Reiner's brutality dons him.

It was a degrading fight, unbecoming of a knight.

Besides, it was not the knights led by Rainer who were still desperately defending the royal capital, but the Holy Knights and Temple Knights that Hinata had.

Regardless of which of them was telling the truth, it was Hinata and the others that he wanted to trust.

Some of them supported Elric, but the percentage was getting smaller and smaller.

And when Hinata was in trouble, everyone prayed for her safety in front of the screen.

This wish was fulfilled by the appearance of a certain person.

Small whispers began to escape from the mouths of those who saw the glowing figure.

You're a brave man. ......

"Y-You, brave sir...?"

"It's the brave one!"

"Ma, it's Master Masayuki! "The brave Master Masayuki has returned!"

"Master Masayuki has returned as Emperor..."

And it doesn't take long for them to become a chorus.

"Ma~sayuki, ma~sayuki...!"

The ground trembled with cheers in various underground shelters.


The phenomenon was not only for the people.

The same was true for the surviving royalty and powerful nobles.

No one would be so stupid as to be unable to tell whether Elric's justification was true or false.

Hinata, who had been protecting humanity as the guardian of law and order, had no reason whatsoever to kill the king.

What's more, we are in the middle of a world conference, and the Kingdom of Ingrassia, the venue for the conference, is fully guarded.

If they really wanted the king, they would not act now. If there is anyone who would do such a thing, it is none other than the forces that are trying to bring chaos to human society.

Even the "Three Wise Drunks," the rulers of the underworld, had unofficially offered their cooperation to make sure that this world conference would be a success.

If human society does not develop, the underworld will have no future. It was a very plausible argument, and the upper echelons of the kingdom had chosen to work hand in hand.

Therefore, the only people who would be in disagreement here would be those who are unaware of the situation. In other words, it is the opinion of the leading figures that Prince Elric himself is the ringleader.

The people were bewildered, but thanks to you, Masayuki, they have regained their composure.

"That's all very well, but it puts us in an awkward position.

"Left. If we had let the ringleaders go and left everything in the hands of other nations, we would certainly be criticized later on.

"The palace knights have been destroyed, but there are still other forces at work, are there not?"

"Move the armies on all sides of King's Landing. And all our men."

"Yes, sir!"

And here we are," he said, beginning to plan to bring the situation under control at once.

Masayuki may be a hero, but he is now the emperor of the empire.

Since they couldn't carry him up, they had to sweat it out themselves.


The "Three Wise Drunks" also moved.

The Three Chiefs don't want any confusion in the region. It would be foolish to lose our forces unnecessarily, so I'll just go out with my Musketeers.

Glenda Utley said.

A number of prototype weapons had been secretly developed by the Demon Federation and were never expected to see the light of day. It was the Musketeers, led by Glenda, who were the supplier of these weapons.

They were his prized subordinates who had undergone secretly modified surgery in the Empire. Their individual combat abilities are at least A-ranked, and they are skilled in the use of various types of armaments.

Small anti-tank guns, hand-held Gatling guns, and other vicious weapons. The ammunition used in these weapons was not just ordinary, but a hazardous material that was designated for use only by those with specialized knowledge. Their power could only be guessed at.

Come on, let's go!"

"Ha!" "Ha!" "Ha!"

Good luck.

"Even if you die, your soul will surely be reborn as a demon under God's care!

That's not the kind of thing I'm looking for - thought Glenda, but she smiled, thinking that it was a colleague's way of being considerate.

Then, with less than a hundred men in tow, he leapt onto the battlefield.






◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇






Masayuki was bewildered by the rapidly changing situation.

I've been completely left out of the situation.

However, a comment from Hinata made Masayuki feel even more trapped.

So, how long are you going to keep rubbing my chest?"

What the hell?　Masayuki couldn't help but choke back a sigh of relief.

I wasn't rubbing her!　It was just a little touch - he tried to excuse himself, but unconsciously he faced Hinata at close range, and Masayuki tensed at the beauty of her.

There were many beautiful women in the Demon Federations, but they were of the nature of extrahuman beauty. Verglind was no different, and she had deviated from the realm of humanity.

Hinata's beauty, on the other hand, had a familiar Japanese look to it. Her beauty had been enhanced by being a saint, but she also had a unique charm that made her feel at ease.

But don't be fooled by appearances.

Masayuki has been told a lot by Rimuru.

He said that Hinata must never be offended.

Even Verdra agreed with him.

She's a persistent woman. No matter what you do, she will surely take revenge on you," he warned me with a straight face.

If you do anything wrong, you will be in trouble. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea.

Although she was pretending to be calm at this moment, Hinata was also very upset. She had never had her breasts squeezed by another person before, so she was wondering how she should react.

If this had been an intentional act, he could have dealt with it accordingly, but in the case of Masayuki, it was an act of force majeure. But in Masayuki's case, it was a force majeure. This made Hinata's judgment hesitate, and in the end, saved Masayuki's life.

"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do it on purpose. ......"

He couldn't think of a good excuse, but his words were interrupted by Hinata.

I'm kidding. I know it was force majeure."

He answered with a smile, but Masayuki couldn't stop the cold sweat from running down her spine. In fact, he had no idea what was going on.

I can't keep up with the understanding.

He wanted to tell her honestly, but he felt like he would be doomed if he did, so he had to keep quiet.

You can't be seriously offended just because someone rubs your chest. Come on, Masayuki. I'll let you squeeze them as much as you want.

And then Verglind laughs and drops the bomb.

I couldn't say, "No, thank you. Masayuki is a boy too.

However, I would really like to ask you to do that in a quiet place where people don't see you.

Hinata stared at them, but moaned in pain as she tried to get up.

"Hi, Hinata-sama!"

Cardinal Nikolaus ran over to Hinata and picked her up. Her arms and legs were still perforated and she could not even stand up.

We will treat you immediately!

Nikolaus panicked, but he performed sacred magic and high-level recovery with great skill. Hinata immediately recovered and returned to the battlefield.


Thus, the renewed battle resumes.

"Hi, Hinata-sama, ...... are you okay?　Why don't you leave this to Masayuki-dono?"

Nikolaus called out to her, but Hinata brushed off his suggestion.

Masaki was shocked when he heard Nikolaus' words, but he was greatly relieved to know that Hinata had no intention of doing so. Masayuki was relieved to know that Hinata was not going to do anything about it. "Don't be reckless," she said, "I have no choice but to ask Hinata to do her best.

Hinata gave a small smile, as if she knew this.

It was a cruel smile, just like that of Hinata, a beautiful woman in men's clothes.

In fact, Hinata had lost her temper with Rainer.

And more than that, he could not forgive himself for his mistake of being careless.

Everything's fine. I'm done checking on you."

It was a declaration of victory.

There is not the slightest room for sympathy for someone who has tortured you so much.

Hinata had a complete readout of the path to victory.

Hinata smiled benevolently and looked at Rainer.

However, his eyes remained cold.

"Well," he said. I'm going to deal with you for real, so be prepared."

"Crap!　You're the big sinner who killed the king, and you licked me. ...... I'm done playing with you!　I'll kill you. I'll kill you, you cowardly bastard!

"That's a funny thing to say. You're the one who's being mean."

Reiner gritted his teeth, thinking that there was nothing more annoying than having the truth pointed out to him.

"Damn, you didn't get it, did you? I was taking it easy on you because you're a woman, you know.　I was taking it easy on you because you're a woman, so that you wouldn't accidentally kill me. And yet, I can't forgive your attitude.

His eyes were bleeding with excitement, and Rainer's mind was on the verge of going insane.

Anticipating this, Hinata agitated him.

"Hmm, is that so?　Go ahead and prove it to me."

Hinata could no longer let her guard down.

He understands that Reiner does not have a chivalrous spirit, and he has no intention of showing mercy to a lowly person.

Reiner understood this, and barked, his face turning red.

"No more crying allowed. All right, I'll grant you your wish!　I'll slash and slash and slash, over and over again!"

Rainer's only goal was to show off his strength to his subordinates and the public by twisting Hinata with overwhelming power. Normal judgment was no longer something he could hope for.

Perhaps sensing this, Hinata looked coldly at Rainer. There was not a shred of kindness in her eyes, and they were filled with contempt.

Rainer rushes toward Hinata.

Hinata did not panic, but held the phantom rainbow fine sword at the ready.

Then the swords cross.

"Die, die, die, die!　Die, die, die, die, die...!"

Reiner shouts with a look of madness on his face.

The sword that he swung with all his might had the power to kill, but it was no longer able to penetrate Hinata.

If he took it seriously, even the Phantom Rainbow Fine Sword would shatter, but there was no need to meet it head-on.

Don't be shy anymore.

Even though Reiner's physical ability was greater than hers, it was not a problem for Hinata. She lightly dodged Reiner's sword and stabbed him through the gap in his armor.

"Aaahhhh!"

Screaming Reiner.

Intense pain rushed through his entire body, and he regained his composure a little.

(What the hell is this pain?　Didn't I, didn't I get so powerful that I couldn't be attacked half-heartedly?)

He had become a servant of Vega and had acquired the power of a demon tribe of the level of a "councilor". And now that he had been given a mythical weapon, there was no way he could be defeated by the likes of Hinata. In addition, the fact that he could feel pain was unusual.

I could not hide my confusion at the fact that my "pain blocker" was not effective. The damage itself was not serious, but the pain showed no signs of receding.

Rainer gritted his teeth. Earlier he had thought he was just out of sorts, but now he was starting to show serious impatience.

"Mmm-hmm. Did I hurt you?　Cry and whine some more and entertain me!"

Hinata looked ecstatic and moistened her lips with her tongue glossily.

This gesture suited Hinata very well.

It reminds me of the way a superior preys on a subordinate.

Nikolaus was looking at Hinata with a passion, but Masayuki was disgusted. It was a gesture that created an enthusiastic fan base among some of the sexually inclined, but for Masayuki, it was a gomenashi.

(This guy is scary!　Let's make sure we don't offend Hinata-san. ......)

He was truly convinced that Limuru was right.

Not caring about the reaction of the people around her, Hinata gave chase to Rainer.

Fearing the incomprehensible sting of pain, Rainer tried desperately to defend himself. However, it was not a sweet attack that he could escape from.

"Die! "Nanasai demise stabbing attack..."

With a fluid movement, Hinata accurately pierced the liner.

Each blow was accompanied by intense pain and tormented Rainer.

(This much!　As long as you can endure the pain...)

It was impossible for him to endure because his mind was being destroyed. In the first place, even though Rainer's physical body had been strengthened tremendously, his mental side was still immature. Even if he had absorbed the demon race, which is a spiritual life form, the protection of his mind had not been strengthened.

"Oh, help me, Mr. Vega!　I can't get rid of the pain!

Reiner tried to recover from the damage he had sustained, but he could not heal his mental wounds. It was natural that he didn't have that kind of power, but Rainer was in a state of panic due to the pain, and he even lost his normal judgment due to the intense fear and suffering.

Moreover, the time spent in pain was longer just because the mental body had been enlarged poorly.

It's so bad, I'd rather be dead...






*






When we first started fighting, it was Venom who was the main opponent to Arios.

The three remaining members of the team were providing assistance and keeping Arios in check.

Masayuki stood with her arms crossed, watching Venom engage.

To be honest, just standing there rather than watching the battle is a better description.

The occasional luminescence was like proof that the battle was still going on. For Masayuki, it was an impossible task to understand this with his eyes.

It wasn't fast enough for me to follow with my eyes, and it was impossible for me to understand what was happening. It was impossible to understand what was going on, just pretending to be able to see.

(I mean, there's nothing you can do about that.)

Not wanting to get in the way, the battle was left completely to others.

Masayuki now knew exactly what he was capable of. He is on the verge of enlightenment, and his sense of fear has diminished.

Still, I'm afraid of something.

As if to distract himself from his fear, Masayuki recalled a happy memory.

Yes, it was the feeling that remained in his right hand - the memory of the softness and warmth of Hinata's breast.

(That's right, Mr. Glynn would let me rub him without asking, but he doesn't, does he? (That's right, Mr. Glynn would let me rub him without asking, but he doesn't. He's kind of afraid of what might happen later, and I think that's not quite right.)

In this respect, Hinata was wonderful.

It was quite a scary experience, but it was allowed to be force majeure.

Now there is no need to worry about the future.

The idea was to be able to bask in the happiness without worrying about the rest.

Without even realizing it, Masayuki's happy mood had a tremendous effect on the place.

The "Fortune Realm," which is said to grant fortune correction in response to Masayuki's wishes, provides immense blessings to all those who side with Masayuki. ......

He had reached the truth of this world - the ultimate ability of the "King of Heroes" was in full effect.

As such, Venom and his team had a relative advantage in the battle.

Venom attacked without hesitation, as if he were strolling along.

"Destroy, divide and conquer!"

The claws on both of Venom's hands were jet black and long. The surface of those claws vibrated finely, a technology that emitted waves that split all matter.

He clicks his tongue and Arios avoids it. But it doesn't end there.

That's sweet."

The Minute aimed at Arios, who had lost his stance, leaving behind a muttered "I'm sorry, I'm sorry". He tilted his body in a very unnatural way and rushed forward like a cannonball, ignoring gravity and inertia.

With his unique skill, "Oppressor," he adjusted his trajectory to Arios, forming an obstacle-free path. On top of that, he compressed and exploded the air under his feet to gain thrust.

The Minute reached its maximum speed in an instant, and without giving Arios a chance to compose himself, he unleashed a series of blows.

"You little fish, you're getting carried away!"

After being head-butted in the jaw and knee-kicked in the gut, Arios glared at Minute in rage.

But Arios had no time for that.

I'm good at assassinations.

A black flash of light ran through the air, cutting through Arios. Jiu, who had been hiding in perfect cover, had aimed for the moment when Arios' consciousness turned to the minutes.

It's a great way to make sure that you don't get caught in the middle of the action. It's a must-have blow for Bernie, who condensed the lightning storm and fused it with his spear technique.

Don't forget about me, either.

Even though he had lost the ultimate grant of the right to act on his behalf, it was a right he had once acquired. Bernie had been able to recreate his previous powers to a certain extent in an effort to be of use to Emperor Masayuki.

It was the same for Jiu.

By the way, the Minute was stronger than before, but it seemed to have been blown away by the experience, just as he boldly said he loved to fight.

Maybe it has something to do with the strength of will that makes the more abnormal personalities stronger. That's what Bernie thinks, but he's not stupid enough to say it. Here, she honestly believes that strong friends are reassuring.

This is why the four of them were putting up a good fight against Arios, who was incomparably stronger in terms of existence value.

And that didn't change even when Arios got serious.

"I don't have time to play around here. I'm going to get serious, so be prepared."

Arios politely declared that he had two daggers in his hands, and before he knew it, he was holding them. The mythical two-sword style is Arios' original style of close combat.

(Damn them ...... for interfering with me when they're only halfway competent. ......)

Arios said indignantly.

Arios had no doubt that this would allow him to dispose of the mooks without much trouble.

It turns out that it was carelessness in the next attack.

A slash of divine speed struck Venom, cutting off the black claws that he had barely caught. The vibrations that cut through all matter were powerless in front of the mythical class - or so it seemed.

Arios looked at Venom with a smile on his face, not changing his expression as a natural result.

It was a look as if he were looking at an insect.

His face was full of pride, as if to say, "This is the difference in power between you and me," but it was distorted by an impossible situation. Pain shot through both of Arios' arms.

"Hahaha, look at that!　I got lucky. I didn't think I'd get two stabs."

Arios' expression twitched when he heard Venom's laughter, "I'm sorry, but I don't think so.

As Venom pointed out, Arios had one black claw in each of his arms.

Arios was so proud of his overwhelming superiority that he looked down on Venom and the others as inferior. And yet, he was wounded.

He hadn't been serious earlier, but this time he wasn't. I can say with certainty that there was no carelessness, and that's why Arios' mind was getting impatient.

You think I wanted to do this?

Well. I was hoping for a little luck, but it's my lucky day again."

I thought I'd be lucky to snag one," Venom said, making no secret of his true feelings.

Yes. When I work with Masayuki, I am loved by fortune every day.

It wasn't the kind of luck that would make him popular with women or win at gambling, so he couldn't really feel it, but he had a feeling that everything he did would go better than expected.

You've got to be kidding me... I'm not going to let you get away with this.

"Idiot!　You just said you were going to get serious!

Venom cheerfully incites Arios, who is tinged with anger.

Venom was now using himself as bait.

The larger the gap between Arios and the others, the easier it would be for them to move.

Venom may be mocking Arios with his mouth, but he is not letting his guard down at all. He quickly regenerated his severed black claws and focused his consciousness on Arios' movements.

That's just as well.

Venom would never be overconfident in his power.

This is because it has not been long since I was reincarnated as a demon, and thanks to the overwhelming presence of Diablo teaching me about myself, I have acquired the habit of looking at myself from a thoroughly objective perspective.

(It's tough. (It's a tough one.) While this good fortune lasts, we're still completely outmatched in terms of ability. I'd like to switch places with Bernie and concentrate on being an attacker instead of a decoy...)

This time, Venom was assigned to play the role of decoy because he was judged to be the least likely to die. Normally, Bernie plays the main role of shield, so this time the roles were irregularly assigned.

The so-called evasive shield was the role that Venom was required to play.

If Arios attacked, it would be the end. That's why it was decided that Venom was the best choice, as he was hard to hit and would not die instantly.

(But if you die, it's going to take hundreds of years to revive you. I really hope you don't do this.)

Venom's nerves sharpened as he thought about this.

His friends, Bernie and the others, understood that Venom was really desperate. That's why they were in no hurry to link up with him.

Minute's role is to distract Arios with a series of big moves. It didn't matter if they could get through or not, the goal was to keep the attack going.

"Attack is the best defense," as the saying goes, and with Minute around, Venom was able to get around just fine.

Bernie's "cognitive disinhibition" blocked the power of Arios, and although it was not complete, it kept the influence of the "King of Punishment" small.

This also made it easier for the Minute's attacks to work. Of course, he also acted as a second shield, attacking at key points and making sure that the Minute could move freely.

And Ji-woo has become a real trump card in the sense of the word.

Unlike Arios, Jiu's hiding form was of a nature that only Jiu himself could hide from. But that was enough for him.

Needless to say, it will come in handy in battle.

The diminutive Jiu activates his ability the moment he disappears from Arios' sight. He then unleashes a deadly blow, aiming for the point where Arios is completely caught off guard.

Unfortunately, Arios was not weak enough to be defeated by that, but the damage was still steadily accumulating.

Each person's role had its own meaning, and with the influence of Masayuki's "lucky realm", it worked as the most splendid combo ever.

Arios had underestimated that he was dealing with a lower-ranked opponent, but unbeknownst to him, he had found himself in a tight spot.

（I'm being pushed, you idiot!)

The situation had deteriorated in earnest while I was still feeling abhorrent.

I was tossed around without realizing it, and time just flew by.

If he continues like this, he will incur the wrath of Feldway. Knowing this very well, Arios lost his cool and became more and more impatient. ......






*






Rolling on the ground, Rainer is screaming.

However, no one wants to help Rainer.

As of now, Hinata has defeated Reiner, but Feldway is still alive and well. Vergrind is dealing with him, but as long as the "Royal Citadel" is there, his attacks won't work.

And as for Reiner's men, the duo of Moss and Cien had already stopped them. They were fighting with a surprisingly relaxed attitude.

Moss was checking him out, and Cien was bringing him into a one-on-one situation, with Ciret and Nikolaus helping out. By following up with Cien, using magic to stop his movements, he was able to take advantage of the situation.

There was no room for Arios either.

That's why none of the Feldways have the luxury of worrying about Reiner. Well, the correct answer might be that they don't care even if they did.

As proof of this, Vega, the one who was asked for help, was smirking as he dealt with Testarossa.

Shouldn't I be helping your friend?"

Ha!　He's a minion, not a friend. But yes, he is. Maybe it's time to move on."

Testarossa had a bad feeling when she heard Vega's statement.

(This guy's up to something. ......)

In the fight so far, he had noticed that Vega was using the corpses to recover from damage. But that wasn't all, he had a feeling that he was hiding more powers.

That reading was correct.

You've got it all wrong, man. You're mistaken, I'm not serious yet. You're trying to figure out how to kill me, but you don't need to worry about that.

What do you mean?"

"Han!　You're an idiot, aren't you? I'm telling you, you can't beat me like this!"

Hearing this, Testarossa was almost furious.

But he stopped and observed Vega with a cold stare.

(This thing seems to be gaining strength little by little, even during the current battle. I wonder if this arrogant attitude is not just a bluff?)

He saw through that and refrained from acting out of anger.

Vega declared to Testarossa.

"Heh, it's about time Mr. Feldway got impatient. I'll give you my best shot, and you can die in despair!"

Vega said, smiling broadly.

And...

He unleashed the power that he had just learned to handle in the fullness of time.

That was the beginning of the nightmare.

"Wake up, dragon beast..."

Vega ignored Testarossa and put his hands on the ground.

It is a production.

In fact, there was no need for him to do so, but he dared to act in a way that would leave no room for Testarossa.

Testarossa doesn't get caught.

He was ready to calmly analyze what was about to happen.

An evil surge gushed from the palm of Vega's hand. It traveled through the earth and engulfed Reiner's men who were lying on the ground.

Those who are already dead and those who are still alive are equally affected. However, avoiding only Elric was a quirk.

Moss. Gather everyone."

Moss moved in response to Testarossa's voice.

He called Bernie and the others back to Masayuki's place to protect her from Vega's waves.

Venom and Cien were no exception, and they all gathered in one place.

And then we had to watch with bated breath to see what would happen.

The living and the dead are twisted together in front of everyone's eyes.

Then, it turned into an evil life form that emitted a foul smell.

Reiner was no exception.

Hey, hey!　My brother, Vega's brother...!　Help me, help me, help me, help me with this sludge. ────

He was in pain, but he was desperately seeking help for Vega.

However, Vega only smiled and laughed at Reiner.

Reiner had been a pawn from the start. That's why I can use him as a test subject for my new power without hesitation.

"Oh, brother. Don't worry. I'll help you as many times as you need me to."

"Are you sure?"

Vega's smile deepened into a wide grin as he reassured Rainer.

The sludge from the melting corpses attacked Rainer, who was relieved to see it.

Seeing this, it was Alios who paled.

"Hey, Vega!　You're not going to use me as your test subject, are you?

Vega smirked.

You're gonna do it, aren't you?

"You...!　I won't allow it. Just because you're the leader of the Seven Heavens doesn't mean you can get away with this kind of arrogance!

Arios was furious, but his lower body had already been swallowed by the sludge.

"Fe, Master Feldway!　Please help me!　Vega is out of control. If this continues, I'll be..."

Arios' desperate cry was sadly silenced by Feldway.

Not because it was hard to deal with Verglind, but because he wasn't interested.

Besides, if useless people were being strengthened, he didn't see the need to stop them.

"God damn it!"

Arios, too, sank into the sludge, leaving behind an exclamation of

And I'm ready.

The corpses melted and twisted together, and the sludge formed into several human shapes.

This was the moment when a fearless creature was born into this world.

It was Vega's power to recreate the demon death netherworld that produced the demon death tribe.

Of course, the effect is not the same.

This was the true essence of Vega's ultimate ability, "Evil Dragon King", "Organic Domination" and "Replica Mass Production".

In Vega's words, "Evil Dragon Beast Production" - the ability to create evil life forms to be his loyal Shimobe.

There were four evil dragon beasts born in total. Although they resembled human beings, their appearance was nothing short of hideous.

The whole body of the evil dragon beast was covered with black scales that were deformed by the mythical class without any gaps. On its belly was a large cleft, reminiscent of the shape of a mouth with teeth.

On its back were two pairs of black, stained wings of a bird of prey. It seemed to be the remnants of an angel that had been taken in.

The most distinctive feature of the creature was its head, which was a slippery mass from the neck up. There were two hollow-like holes in it, and red eyes glittering in the blackness.

It's not a person anymore.

It's a wriggling man-made creature with a hint of evil in it.

Since he did not have a head to begin with, his eyes did not have the light of intelligence in them. However, he seemed to have the ability to make decisions, and was glaring at Hinata, Venom and the others with hatred, perhaps influenced by the hatred he had felt before his death.

"Gwahahahahahaha!　What do you think, my lovely pets!　It looks like the small fry have been working hard in packs, but that's over now. This "evil dragon beast" is too powerful for small fry like you to fight, so enjoy it to the fullest!

Vega laughs loudly.

Then he crossed his arms and commanded, "Play with him," he said.






◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇






Despite the evil dragon beast's distorted life, its fighting ability was very high.

He has no eyes, but that's not a problem since he has "magic sensing" to begin with. He accurately grasped the situation around him and acted on orders.

The individual existence values had reached 2.4 million. This is more than the average Mushroom General, so you can understand how much of a threat the Evil Dragon Beast is.

Of course, it was obvious to those who were confronting us, without needing to be explained.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Seriously, ......

Venom muttered.

He feels that he is in serious trouble.

It was tough even against Arios, but these four were out of the question. It was only thanks to Masayuki that they had managed to fight, and the evil dragon beasts were unlikely to be able to play any kind of battle tactics.

The element of emotion has both good and bad sides. The prideful Arios had not been able to show his true strength due to his impatience. It was also the influence of Masayuki's "lucky realm" that had attracted such bad aspects.

This time, however, such elements have been eliminated.

The fact that it seemed to have no intelligence was an advantage in some cases, but for the evil dragon beast, which seemed to have only attack instincts and an unparalleled sense of combat, it seemed to have no inconvenience at all by simply being a fighting machine.

Venom had sensed it with his super intuition.

This is a dangerous thing to deal with.

Hinata also broke out in a cold sweat and became alarmed.

Hinata's survival instincts were warning her that the evil dragon beast was dangerous.

The black scales that covered its outer skin were impossible to penetrate, even with Hinata's phantom rainbow fine sword.

The only possibilities are the eyes and the mouth on the belly,......, which Hinata judged to be unlikely.

That's why I'm telling the holy knights who have gathered here one after another.

"Attention all holy knights below the rank of captain. Get a large distance from the target and form a formation!　In order to keep that evil being from escaping this place, and to prevent that Vega person from gaining any more power, you must isolate this place with a ward!

The Holy Knights who had come responded immediately to this order.

For some reason, the monsters that had been rampaging in various places suddenly melted into the ground. In order to find out the cause, we came to the center of the disaster, where an unimaginable situation was occurring.

The morale of the holy knights was on the verge of falling when they saw the evil dragon beast, which was clearly beyond their control. However, Hinata's blackmail gave them a purpose and revived their fighting spirit.

"Yes, of course. We'll do what we can now."

Cardinal Nikolaus nodded broadly.

Yes, Master Hinata.

Fritz nodded.

"Well, ......, this kind of thing, we'd just be making more sacrifices."

Ritis doesn't disagree. She was scared, but she couldn't just run away here.

"Leave it to me!　We'll show you the results of our training here."

Bacchus laughs. Everyone noticed that he was in a hollow mood, but his laughter seemed to give him a strange kind of energy.

Let's go, then!"

Finally, Arnaud shouted, bringing everyone together.

Everyone nodded loudly in agreement with his spirit.

We will not give up just because the enemy is unruly. If we run away here, our future will remain bleak.

Cardinal Nicolaus and the four captains of the Holy Knights. The members of the Holy Knights who followed them began to act in accordance with a number of training patterns.

They scattered in five directions around the square and took up positions as if drawing a pentagram. Then, they constructed a "quarantine ward" that gathered the power of all of them.

This time, although the enemy was evil, it did not use magical elements as its energy source. No, although magical elements are energy, they also take in other forces, so the effect of the holy purification wards was expected to be limited. In fact, considering the fact that there are demon forces within this ward, it was judged that they might be a drag on it.

This is why Hinata chose the "All Things Isolation Boundary" to completely isolate this place from the rest of the world.

Hinata's choice was supported by Testarossa.

That's great. Cien, Venom, you should help him. If we don't reinforce the wards a little bit, he'll go looking for food under the ground."

The bait was the evacuated residents of the royal capital.

Testarossa had hypothesized Vega's authority with some accuracy in his previous attacks and defenses.

As long as it was within the influence of Vega's power, any organic matter would become Vega's bait. So far, it was only being overlooked because it was ineffective, but there was no telling when the slaughter would start in order to recover the damage.

The possibility of this was the reason why Testarossa had not relaxed his attack.

You guys should help him.

Verglind ordered the minutes.

"But we will not let you..."

I'm here, there's no way I'm going to let you touch Masayuki, not even with your fingers. Now get out of here."

"'Thank you'."

Minute, Bernie, and Jiu. The three of them were also dispersed in various directions to help maintain the "barrier of universal isolation". Thus, only the strongest people remained in this place.

Confronting Feldway, Verglind.

Testarossa, still facing Vega.

Moss, in the form of a boy.

Hinata, who has been revived, and Masayuki, who is just standing there with his arms crossed.

That's five people in total.

(Why am I still here?)

There were a few people who wondered about this, but no one offered a helping hand or even a suggestion.


Finally, the situation was set in motion.

Go play with him.

With a word from Vega, the four evil dragon beasts began to move in unison at a furious speed.

Following orders, they kicked the ground, flew through the air, and pounced on the prey that each of them had set their sights on...

CHAPTER 4

I was facing the biggest crisis of my life as I confronted Mikhail. I feel like I'm in this situation all the time, but this time it's for real.

The truth is that there is nothing that can be done about it, since Diablo has been defeated by Mikael's unexplained attack.

The only reason I can afford to be like this is because Verdra is waiting for me in the labyrinth. As long as Verdra is safe, I can revive myself.

But...

Are you sure you're okay?


There's no problem, but if you're worried, all you have to do is not lose.


That's true, isn't it?

Ciel, you're so right, it's hard to respond to you because you're so right.

If I could do that, I wouldn't have any trouble, and since it seems impossible, I'm worried and anxious about it.


I'm fine. I've already taken steps to deal with this kind of thing... will you take immediate action?


Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

I haven't heard a thing, but you've already taken care of that, haven't you?

Why do you try to deceive ......, or maybe it's on purpose because you're not deceiving.


I'm sorry. Since you're here, may I activate emergency response mode?


When you say "ne" instead of "ka", I'm sure you're ready to trigger it. ......

Well, okay.

It's what Ciel does, so it won't be as bad.

Apparently there is a way in the back, and I'd like to think there is some hope.


We will make every effort to meet your expectations.


Ciel's motivation seemed to light up when she realized that I was convinced. I had no idea how this would affect me. If that was the case, I should have taken action instead of worrying.

I'm not going to get an answer anyway...so let's attack.

It wasn't like I was going to give up and try to finish the job, but I was feeling pretty relaxed about it. I'm going to try everything I can, with the intention of gathering information to use next time.

I don't want this experience to go to waste, even if I have to play it off anyway. I'm risking my life here, and I want to get as much useful information as possible.

With that thought in mind, I readied my sword.

But I guess I was too naive.

"I admire you for not despairing. But you are no match for me."

The moment I heard Mikael's super-supercilious comment, I stopped moving.

No, I wasn't the only one who stopped.

Everything in the world had come to a halt.

I know this feeling...


Was that so after all?


What? What is it?


I'm sure you're aware of that, but I'm not.


Well, could that be the pattern of the ...... example of deja vu that was right?


You're right. This is definitely a "time stop.


Huh?

You can't win that!

That's a foul.

It may be acceptable in a manga or anime, but if it were done in real life, I would be disgusted.

"It seems that I was right in recognizing that those who cannot reach the stopped world are no match for those who do, no matter how strong they are.

In fact, there was nothing I could do.

Well, even Diablo would lose. I thought I couldn't imagine him losing, but I guess it's inevitable when you can stop time.

Yes, break it up!

Now, just admit defeat and... what?

Time stands still now, doesn't it?

Why are we even having this conversation?


Thanks to the Emergency Response Mode, I can now recognize the stopped world!


Are you serious?

You're the master of your craft, Dr. Ciel!

The report was a bit smug, but I could forgive it now, and was very grateful.

I was so relieved that this was going to work out... but I was so wrong.

He realized this when he recognized Mikhail's sword approaching him.

I rushed to deal with it, but my body didn't even twitch.

Even if you can recognize a stopped world, it doesn't mean you can move - this was quite natural when you think about it.

Ciel was so smitten, I thought I could handle it. ......

Well, I didn't manage to do it, so it's not my place to complain.

It was a bit of a blessing in disguise, but oh well. Even if I were to give up and let Mikael cut me down, I would still like to remember his sword strokes and fighting habits for the next time.


No, it's too early to give up.


I was about to give up, but Ciel-san appeased me.

And the next thing I knew, I felt a clear, resonant tone.

This feeling is familiar to me, and I even feel a sense of déjà vu. I'm pretty sure it was...

"Dr. Rimuru, I'm here to help!"

Yes, it's Chloe.

As I was helpless against Michael's sword, my long black and silver hair swept in front of me as if to spread silver light around me.

In his hand is the "Divine Feminine Sword of Moonlight" and on his body is the "Divine Spirit Armament" - the fine sword of moonlight and the "Holy Spirit Armament" entrusted to him by Hinata. I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that I'm not the only one.

Needless to say, the owner is the beautifully grown "hero" Chloe.






*






Well, Chloe had arrived, but I was still stuck in the middle of nowhere.

I mean, it's impossible for me to respond...


No problem, sir. It turns out that the Informant is unaffected by time or space, and can transmit information to any point in time. In other words, it can transmit thoughts even in a stationary world.


I see.

The "conversation" between me and Ciel, that's what's happening instantly. As for the voice I heard from Chloe, however, there was a slight time difference.

The cause of that remains unknown, though?

If the informants are unaffected by time and space, then it would seem that communication would be instantaneous.


I am a part of the Lord, so I am not affected by time at all. However, if I want to know what's going on outside in the world that's stopped, I need to fly an "informant" to grasp the information around me...


Hmm, that's hard to explain.

In short, the "informant" is not affected by space-time, so it can move in any situation. That's why, as a substitute for the magical element, you can interfere with the "informants" to secure your vision and transmit your thoughts.

In other words, it would take more than just interfering with the informant to work in this situation. Chloe seemed to be talking normally, but I guess we shouldn't confuse her with the real world.

I thought that I was accelerating my thoughts, but it seems that this is not the case. It seems that we are just exchanging "informants" with no time difference, and this is possible because we share the same "soul".

So, if you are trying to communicate your intentions to a third party in this "stopped world"...


All you have to do is put your intentions on the "informant" and hit your opponent with it.


I know it sounds rough, but I understand it well.

Ciel is now able to interfere with the informants, so she can reply to them.

In the first place, the reason I can see what's going on around me right now is because I'm reflecting the "informants".

I was wondering if the speed of the "informant" was constant in this "stopped world", but I was glad to hear that the conversation seemed to work.

"Thank you for your help!　But I don't think I can move yet, so..."

I immediately sent my intentions to Chloe.

Chloe then responded with a "thought transfer" to match mine.

"Yes, I know. I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.

"Well, something."

"Yes, Rimuru has 'Ciel' in her name. Is it any wonder you can do this?"

Oh, Chloe knew Ciel, too.


Yes. Through Klonoa, my existence was also known. That's why he secretly took on the role of my escort this time.


Yeah, that makes sense.

So that was the trump card that Ciel had hidden in her hand.

I mean, if you've been doing this long, you must have guessed that it was too dangerous.


Yes. I had not been able to determine the enemy's aim, but there was no doubt that they were targeting Masayuki Honjo. Similarly, I had guessed that there was a high possibility that the Lord was being targeted.


Oh, you mean you used me as bait?

That's an unusual decision for Ciel, who always plays it safe to the point of excess.

Huh?

You may have heard of the "Ote-biwashi" at .......


Yes. It was a metaphor for Mikael, who thought he had a claim on the Lord.


Damn it, I'm hit!

I'm ashamed of myself for not noticing.

At that time, I felt that Ciel was being stagnant in her words.

My answer wasn't wrong, but it wasn't right either. It was because I wasn't sure whether to point it out or not!


I thought that Mikhail would naturally assume that the Lord would go out to bring Leon back to his senses. Then, on the other hand, it was expected that he would use Leon as bait, so how much importance Mikael would place on this, and how much force he would put into it, that was the point where I couldn't make a decision.


Oh, that's right.

No, it's only natural, when you think about it. I've already brought Verglind back to his senses.

Mikael and Feldway were not so stupid as to think that Verglind had come back on his own.

I just found out that my thinking was too shallow. ......

That's why Mikhail would be wary of getting Leon back, so he would take some measures. It's not so much that he cares about Leon, but that he wants to take advantage of the situation.

In other words, Mikhail's plan was to use Leon as bait to lure me out. In addition to that, Ciel had planned this operation in anticipation of that.

No room for me to intervene.

It's simple when it's explained to you, but due to the fact that both of them are reading two or three moves ahead, even the slightest deviation in the middle of the game is going to lead to a major failure.

No, that's why.

If I hadn't gone to him, Mikael would have taken a different approach, so it was easier for Ciel to read the situation if I pretended to be fooled and went to him.

My safety is guaranteed when Verdra is around, so you've decided that it's better to dare to go along with Mikael's plan.


Yes. Of course, I took the utmost care for the Lord's safety.


I'm sure you're right.

It's scary that it was as I read it so far, but what even Ciel didn't calculate was that Mikael also had the ability to "stop time"?


《Since that was also a possibility, I negotiated with Chloe Oberle to have her stand by just in case.


So you guessed that Chloe wouldn't be in the game. But Mikhail was too strong, so she ended up being saved by Chloe.

Even Ciel couldn't see what was going on, so there was nothing for me to do.


It was the biggest miscalculation that Mikael was even able to handle 'time stop'. But in the end, I think it was a good thing.


Hmm?

Why is that?


Since there are very few people who can handle this power, I can say that it is a very valuable experience. It was fortuitous that we succeeded in developing an emergency response mode. It's only a matter of time before I'll be able to move if I observe the Stopped World like this.


Your confidence is as strong as ever.

I guess I'm losing it if I go into it, like it's a matter of time when time stands still. I feel like I'm frying, so I'll just admire him for being honest here.

What I'm wondering is whether we will really be able to move in the stopped time. If we can't do that in the future, we won't be able to talk about it, and clearing this problem is our most urgent task.

That's why I have to rely on Chloe now. ......

Anyway, there's nothing I can do about it now.

In all seriousness, he decided to wait and see how the battle between Chloe and Michael would play out.






*






Perhaps wary of Chloe's appearance, Mikhail did not move.

Finally, however, he lifted the sword in his right hand with a flickering motion.

"I honestly can't believe that something so unexpected could happen.

"Yeah?"

"I didn't know there was anyone other than me and Velzard who could move in this stopped time. I don't know how they could have reached this realm, let alone an ultimate being like me, a theosophical nucleus."

Oops, Michael said the word "theosophical nucleus" himself here...is that a trick?

The idea seems to be that if Chloe reacts, we can get closer to finding out what it is.

I was a little worried and thought about advising Chloe, but there was no need.

"Hmm, really?　That was surprisingly easy."

And Chloe showed her a light touch through it.

The response reminded me of that.

I can't help but think of her as my own student, but Chloe is a warrior in her own right. She had traveled a long, long time and was the strongest "hero" in the world.

I didn't have to worry about it, since it also had a theosophical nucleus called Klonoa.

"Stop laughing. The reaction of the 'King of Hope' has disappeared from you, are you willing to answer why?"

Oh, I knew it.

I had thought that Michael would be able to detect angelic ultimate abilities, but now it's confirmed. And the fact that the reaction is gone means that Chloe has successfully sublimated the "King of Hope" and turned it into her own power.


There was no need for me to help. I'm so sorry.


I'm sure it is.

Ciel, who was a power maniac, must have been drooling over Chloe's abilities. If she had been able to find out the secret, she would have been able to move in the "stopped world" by now.

No, I don't think Chloe is stingy, I think Ciel is too foul .......

Is there any reason for me to tell you that?"

No, I don't.

Mikhail didn't seem to expect an answer either, so he silently readied his sword.

Then we're done with uncertainty.

"I agree with you. I'll make you regret making me your enemy."

After that conversation, the battle between Chloe and Mikhail began.


It was one word: tremendous.

As I watched the game, I found out that the speed at which the "informant" moves is constant.

Conversations were taking place, and the speed of visual response was uniform. This was as clear a physical phenomenon as the fact that "all things cannot exceed the speed of light.

If so, why are the "informants" traveling faster than the speed of light?

This isn't over the speed.

It's like two "informants" that are supposed to be at different coordinates are transferring information to each other with zero time difference. It doesn't matter how far they are from each other, as long as the "informants" exist in the recognizable space, there is no time difference. In other words, the "informant" transcends time and space.

Our conversations are also based on the transfer of information between these "informants".

So how can you move?

This could be .......


If it's a mental life form, it's probably transforming all matter into "informants" to become an information life form.


I knew it.

If we assume that the mind and spirit are also information, it seems not impossible.

Whether we can or can't is another question, but it is significant that there is an answer there. I should have eliminated the idea that I couldn't do it and concentrated on how I could reach it.


You're right. I'm going to activate the emergency response mode even more fully and aim to evolve into an information life form, is that okay?


Of course not, Mr. Ciel.

I'll leave everything to you. Do what you want.

I ordered him to do so in a great manner.

Because there's nothing we can do about it as it is, and if there are countermeasures, we should try them all.

Ciel correctly grasped my intentions and started her activities with vigor.

Now we just have to wait for the results.

I'm still worried that I'm leaving it to others, but this is no longer an option.

I made my decision and focused on the battle between Chloe and Mikael.






*






Now, as for Chloe and Mikael's abilities, they were quite competitive.

I can't get an accurate picture, so I'm just guessing, but I think they are evenly matched in terms of physical ability. Or perhaps we should say that they are evenly matched in their ability to interfere with the "informants".

Since the speed has a fixed maximum value, it is the ability to interfere with oneself that determines one's superiority or inferiority. How well can we control the "informants" and outperform the enemy? I guess that will be the key point in the "stopped world.

And there are a few more things that I noticed while observing.

First of all, there is no concept of defense in the "stopped world".

If you are able to move like Chloe and Michael, you can interfere with each other's "informants" to create a battle that is both offensive and defensive.

What happens to those who can't move against it? They are attacked without being able to take any defense. Moreover, the fact that time is stopped means that all "power" is not working.

The intermolecular forces of attraction and repulsion of stars do not work, and there is no binding force at all. There is no inertia, no external factors, so it retains its original form, but what happens if it is attacked in this state?

The answer is simple: it will collapse in an instant.

Whether it is a reinforced concrete wall, a solid rock, or a lump of steel, it has no resistance because the atoms are not even bonded together.

There is nothing in this world that can endure, was the conclusion.

A world where all the laws of physics do not apply is a frightening thing to think about. You never know what is going to happen, and if you enter it carelessly, you might get burned badly.

There is a dimensional barrier that can never be crossed between those who can move and those who can't move in the "stop world.

If you think about it, I'm surprised Diablo and Souei made it out of there. ......


《Diablo seemed to have anticipated this, and activated a magical "defense ward.


Whoa, newsflash.

Diablo's ability to anticipate this situation was amazing, but the fact that magic was effective even in the "stopped world" was an unexpected gain.


But you can't activate magic while in the "Stopped World". You have to prepare in advance, and once the effect is broken, it's over.


Right, so you're safe.

Did Mikhail's "leave no stone unturned" mean to follow up on it?

Oops, what about Souei then?


The reason Souei was safe was because that thing was a 'parallel existence'. Even now, I think it's pretending to be beaten, lurking in the shadow of the Lord, and looking for an opportunity to take Mikhail by surprise.


It doesn't make sense because time has stopped - but Ciel explained to me.

I completely forgot that he was able to use Parallel Existence.

By the way, Souei is a great guy. This is the only time I don't think he's going to be in the game, but normally he's a really reliable guy.


The first point is that the "stop world" has no concept of defense, but another point I noticed was that the one who activates the "stop world" seems to be at a disadvantage.

I can't be sure, but I don't think I'm wrong.

It seems that stopping time consumes a lot of energy. So, if two people can move in the "stopped world," there is no point in keeping them stopped forever.

The reason Mikael hasn't deactivated the Stopped World this time is probably because he doesn't want me to join him.


《Not only that, but it seems to be because repeated stopping and unstopping consumes more energy.


Oh, I see.

It's like an electrical appliance.

If that's the case, Mikael isn't used to "time stopping" either, so he must have unknowingly deactivated it multiple times earlier.


I'm sure of it. I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure you'll be able to figure it out.


Yes, I understood what Ciel was trying to say.

Time is not something that flows only in limited space. It is the "stopped world" that affects the time and space of all worlds.

Since the time when Gee and Chloe fought lightly, there was no sense of discomfort - no sense of time stopping - that I felt at that time. It was proof that, as Ciel said, no one had triggered the time stop.

Well, it's a world that only a limited number of people understand, but I think this power is surprisingly difficult to handle. If the other party can use it, it's meaningless... Wait a minute?

What happens if you aim at the moment the sword hits the opponent?


《That's what I was doing, attacking and defending Gee and Chloe.》


Ah, yes .......

I didn't realize it at the time, but those two were fighting with unimaginable skill. The more I learn about them, the scarier I get.

That means I have to be able to react at a moment's notice. Otherwise, it's not as if I can compete with this level of combat.


I'll make sure to keep up my research as well.


Yes, please.

I had been feeling overwhelmed, but I felt saved by his words.

I was so relieved to know that I had a partner in Ciel.






*






While I was making these considerations, the battle was in its final stages.

Chloe and Mikhail were still antagonistic, but my fingertips twitched. And little by little, I felt the sensation coming back from every part of my body.


Soon, our evolution into an information life form will be complete.


Ciel's words were truly the gospel of victory.

If it's a one-on-one contest, then I'll have the upper hand when I enter the fray.

And the time will come.

"It is time for you to perish, you clever little brave who stands in my way."

That's my line, you know. You bragged about being a theosophical nucleus, but that's nothing unusual."

This is the climax of the verbal psychological warfare.

At this point, Chloe also revealed that she has a "Klonoa" attached to her.

Mikhail is upset by this, and a small gap is created.


And Chloe didn't want to miss it.

"Goodbye, your fate ends here."

A cold-hearted stare pierced Mikhail.

"Reveal all things as they should be..."

It points to the long and short hands, which accelerate the rotation in the opposite direction of the clock.

Chloe's power was still alive and well in this "stopped world". She didn't let us know that until the very end, and then she showed us her decisive move.

The effect was dramatic.

Chloe said to expose all things as they should be, but she didn't mean it like that. You have to change it into what you think it should be for Chloe.

So it's not 'go back'.

And what about Mikael, who was hit by that profound "fate shifting"? ......

"What the heck did I ...... do to ......?　Who was I, who was I ────?"

A hollow existence that resides in Rudra's body. He lost his master, lost the reason for his existence, and went mad to fill that emptiness. Its true identity is...

"The ultimate ability, the King of Justice."

Rudra's body, which had been held together by the effects of the power, began to crumble because it could not withstand the sheer power it contained. Now that Chloe has turned him back into a mere authority, he has no reason to maintain his host.

In front of that emptiness, Chloe speaks softly.

If you've lost your way, will you come with me?"

Hmm?　I thought, but I decided to keep my mouth shut and watch what happened.

"What the...?"

Like me, Michael - or rather, the King of Justice, whose ego as a theosophical nucleus has faded and returned to mere authority, seems to be puzzled by the proposal.

Chloe's proposal was to make me choose between disappearing or staying in this world with her as my master. It's not that easy to give an answer, and I thought it would be better if the King of Justice disappeared and time began to move, but at that moment, the "word of the world" echoed through the "stopped world.


I have confirmed that the three elements of courage, hope, and justice have been gathered in Chloe Oberle. With this, the missing elements of the ultimate ability "King of Hope" have been filled in, and the complete integration into the ultimate ability "King of Time and Space" has begun ...... successfully. The ultimate ability "King of Time and Space" has fully evolved into the ultimate ability "God of Time and Space.


It was already obvious that she had been super-enhanced without being explained. Inside Chloe, the ultimate evolution had taken place without her even being aware of it.

Chloe, are you ...... okay?"

"Yes. Mr. Rimuru, I feel like I've truly become one with Klonoa.

I'd seen the changes in Chloe firsthand, and I wondered if that was true.

I felt as if the faint childishness had disappeared and a seductiveness reminiscent of an adult woman had taken over. This was a characteristic of "Klonoa", so I thought that perhaps...

Chew.


What the...?


Yes?

Chloe, Chloe, what are you...?

Chloe kissed me out of the blue.

I don't know what I'm saying, but I suddenly felt Chloe's beauty approaching me, and then suddenly I felt a soft touch on my lips.

This is now a force majeure.

There would be no need to verify whether it could be avoided or not.

"Uh-huh. I'm an adult now."

Yes, I admit it.

But you know what, I don't think we should take them by surprise.

Well, it's a good thing it was me, because if it was Leon, we'd have a problem, okay?

I'm good, though. I'm good.

And so on, I excused myself to no one in particular.

But why would Chloe suddenly kiss .......

"You need that, don't you, Rimuru?　I just felt like it, you know?"

Even if you say it in such a cute way, ......, what do you need me for?


《──Tsk, bribery is a clever way of doing things. ...... I have received the residue of the "King of Hope" from Chloe. I'm sure there are other ways to do this, so from now on I'll be more vigilant against surprise attacks.


Oh, did I just click my tongue?

I mean, you don't have to be so vigilant. ......


I'll keep it quiet.


Ah, yes.

I don't know why, but I don't feel good about going against him any more.

I think it's a good idea to let Ciel do what she wants, so I decided to change the subject and deceive her.

"So, when you said you became one with Klonoa, did that mean Chloe can't go back to being a child?"

Oh, that's okay.

She was able to change her appearance at will, from a baby to an old woman. Whether it meant anything or not, he was relieved that he hadn't surprised Kenya and the others.

"Then I'm going to release the time stop."

Chloe seemed to have taken over from Michael and was now stopping time. It was as natural as breathing.

It's a little hard to imagine how much stronger I've become.

Even without the assistance of the Theosophical Nucleus, he seemed to be able to control his powers to the fullest. It is a fact that you don't need to dare to say that you are better than me who relies on Ciel.

Oops, I shouldn't have been so impressed.

But first, one thing. Maybe, but after this..."

"Yes, I know. The amount of power you absorbed was less than I expected, so I'm pretty sure you're right."

Okay. Then leave it to me this time, okay? And you, take it easy and get some rest."

I strongly admonished Chloe.

Chloe may look fine, but there's no way she can survive such a rapid evolution. We have to make sure she gets a good night's rest, whether we like it or not.

"Mmm, I'm glad you're concerned."

I'm not fooled.

Even if she smiled at me in such a cute way, I am not Leon. It was time for me to show my dignity as an adult.

"Okay. I'll be quiet for a little while then. So you won't lose, right?"

Of course I do. Thanks to Chloe, I now understand the concept of time.

"Hmm, yes."

I promised Chloe that I would win.

Well, I'm not going to admit that I lost, so it wouldn't be a lie.

So, Chloe lifted the "time stop" and the world started ticking again.






*






I was stopped in time while confronting Mikhail, and to someone who didn't recognize it, it would have looked like Mikhail suddenly disappeared and Chloe appeared.

To be more specific, Souei hurriedly spoke to me through 'thought transference'.

"I'm sorry, Master Rimuru. We lost sight of the enemy..."

"I'm fine, but don't come out yet."

"Yes!　Yes!

That was enough for Souei to realize everything.

He's a competent of competent, so he can talk fast and help.

Then I start acting all white.

"Oh, no, Chloe. Thank you for coming to save me. You almost got me."

"Hmm, you're not a very good actor, are you, Rimuru?"

Shut the fuck up!

I'm a straightforward person at heart, so I'm just not cut out for deception.

"Enough. I'm done cheating. Chloe, I want you to go back and relax."

"Okay. I'll trust you then."

After saying that, Chloe kept her promise to me and returned to the Demon Union. From now on, I'll be healing the aftereffects of my rapid evolution in my room in the labyrinth.

Then I smiled and showed it to the empty space.

Come on out, you're hiding, right?"

"I thought the ...... extra presence was perfectly 'hidden', how did you notice?"

If you ask me why, I'd have to say because it's so common.

In my case, it was a hunch.

It is common knowledge that the moment you think you have won the battle is the moment when the gap becomes the largest. So, he thought, there must be a "parallel existence" lurking in the background.

I mean, I'd do it for sure.

In my case, unlike Vergrind and Souei, I can't split my consciousness, so I can't take that approach, but I would have adopted such a strategy if I could.

He was sure that Mikael would have such a plan in place.

When I tried to warn Chloe about this, she told me that Mikael was using Parallel Existence.

What Chloe had taken in was a part of Mikael. However, she had all the information about the King of Justice, and she was able to find out what Michael was up to.

I was going to wait for Mikhail to take us by surprise, but I decided not to bother. He thought that he should defeat him head on and end his silly ambitions.

"I see. You just read my thoughts, but you did not see through my authority. But even so..."

Mikhail says to me with a slightly surprised look on his face.

I didn't think you'd be able to defeat my parallel existence.

"Well, yeah. It's not me, it's that girl, though."

"The brave Klonoa. I must have underestimated how far he would grow.

"Chloe, not Klonoa. Well, you'll end up here, so there's no need to correct me and remember."

I said, and lightly relaxed my body.

It's been a while since I've fought with all my might. I'm also going to do some preparatory exercises just to be sure.

"Stop laughing. How dare you bark at me when you've only been hiding behind a brave man?"

That's one way to look at it. But you know, Chloe was my student. But Chloe was my student, and if I don't show her my dignity as a teacher here, I'll lose my standing, won't I?"

I answered, but Mikael only gave me a cold stare with no expression.

The look on his face tells me eloquently that he doesn't understand me.

Well, I guess the people who can stop time don't care about me.

But that was just a moment ago.

"Demon Lord Rimuru, you have a bad memory. You were an obstacle to me, but I taught you that you cannot be an enemy. I have taught you that you are an obstacle to me, but you cannot be my enemy.

Are you telling me to die?

Of course you don't want to do that.

Don't tell me what to do, just come and get me.

As soon as I finished saying that, time stopped.

Mikael's sword closes in on me with a look of victory on his face.

But I'm sorry!

I, too, have made this "stopped world" my own.

Even in a world without sound, the auditory hallucination of swords clashing with swords rang out.

"No way, you..."

"You've learned how to move in a stationary world, haven't you?

As I shouted this, I faced Michael with a new expression.

Identify Mikhail as the enemy.

It was the same from Mikael's point of view.

He identified me as an enemy to be defeated and erased his condescending attitude.

And we...

This time, in the true sense of the word, the fate of the world was at stake.






◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇






Verglind was in a difficult situation.

He had said that he would protect Masayuki no matter what, but Feldway was not so lenient as to allow that to happen.

"You've been licked. Vergrind, are you going to single-handedly deal with me?"

"Yes. You're not the only one... What the hell is that?

Feldway, who had been on the defensive until now, unleashed the power he had been hiding in front of Verglind. It was just as powerful as Verglind's, if not more so.

I'm sure you thought there was a parallel existence, but I can use it too. If you're planning on going to save Masayuki, I'll do my best to stop you."

"Damn, you still have that disgusting personality. I hate you so much."

"Really?　I'm sorry to hear that."

Verglind frowned when he heard Feldway's blank reply.

For a long time, Feldway had been the second-in-command of his older brother, Verdunava, and he had been the one to give Verglind a hard time. Remembering that time, Verglind became even more irritated.

Besides, the reality of the situation was also grim.

Verglind had his hands full just dealing with Feldway, and Testarossa, who was the most reliable, was facing Vega himself. In that case, the number of allies was insufficient against the four evil dragon beasts.

(I think I underestimated Feldway too much. Was it a mistake to leave those three out?　No, otherwise it would have been impossible to maintain the quarantine zone. ......)

If we didn't send Minute, Bernie, and Jiu to the various locations, the strength of the All Things Isolation Wards would weaken. In that case, there seemed to be no way to stop Vega from gouging the ground with force and using the evacuated people of the royal capital as bait to replenish his energy.

So, although Verglind's instructions were not wrong, she was worried that she might have made a wrong choice, since she cared about Masayuki the most.

Only Testarossa's beloved Moss and the "Saint" Hinata could protect Masayuki. There was no way they could stop the four evil dragon beasts, and Verglind's heart grew impatient.

By the way, you can't take on all three at once or .......

"I appreciate your understanding, but can you please stop looking at me like I'm a disappointment?　I'm trying my best too!"

The conversation between Hinata and Moss had been overheard, which made him even more worried.

Hinata and Moss each kept the two in check. But that was all they could do, and it didn't look like they would be able to defeat them.

In fact, this was a pretty good fight. They were only able to cope with the evil dragon beasts because they had little experience in fighting them, and they were both outmatched in terms of fighting ability. It would be absurd to expect more than this.

And then there was Testarossa.

"At last, the universal quarantine is complete."

What if it's not?"

"This means I can destroy you without reservation."

That was all well and good until I told her so and began my onslaught. After that, however, we were forced to struggle against Vega's immortality.

Testarossa was by far the more skilled of the two. Although there was a several-fold difference in their existence values, they were not unbeatable opponents.

And yet, Vega had evolved in the middle of the battle.

He ate Arios and even acquired his power.

And now, something has happened to make things worse.

Unknown to Testarossa and the others, Michael's "time stop" had been activated.

Only Verglind and Testarossa were confused by the strange feeling. Both of them immediately realized what had just happened.

Even if they panicked after the time started to move, everything would have been over. Both of us knew that, and that's why we didn't panic.

It was just a small gap.

And that level should have been able to be counteracted by Masayuki's "lucky area".

However, when he felt uncomfortable for the fourth time, something happened to Masayuki.

"What?"

With a murmur, Masayuki fell to his knees on the spot. He was exposed to a sudden dizzy spell, and at that point, the effects of the power disappeared.

"Masayuki!"

Verglind's worried voice echoed...

"Ha ha ha!　Don't look at me like that!"

And then Vega attacked, taking advantage of Testarossa's gap.

Hinata and Moss also found themselves in a difficult situation when their good luck wore off, just when they were struggling.

All of them were in mortal danger just because of Masayuki's condition.

Then comes the worst moment of all.

When Verglind's attention turned to Masayuki, he revealed an opening that he should not have.

Feldway was not so naive as to miss this.

I've won!"

As he shouted this, Feldway's sword pierced Verglind's chest.






*






Masayuki couldn't understand the reality of what was happening in front of her.

A woman who smiled fearlessly, confidently, and always took care of herself no matter what the situation was, was kneeling on the ground holding her chest.

It was a situation that should not have happened.

Feldway was a monster, and he was no match for me, and if Glynn was defeated as well, I had no choice but to run away.

Intense anger.

I realize that I am feeling a rage running through my entire body, from the top of my head to the tips of my toes, threatening to burst out.

What the fuck are you doing to me?

A smaller voice than I expected spilled out of Masayuki's mouth.

Feldway reacts to that.

"Hmm?　You're the real deal, but wait a minute. If you're going to do this, you might as well do it here, and completely destroy Vergrind..."

The words could not be uttered until the end.

I'm asking you what you're doing to my woman!

It was because Masayuki stepped in with blinding speed and struck Feldway sideways with her thin sword.

It was a gem that was forged by Kurobeh's hands, mainly to reduce weight and increase strength, and was equivalent to a special quality class. However, there is no way you can just carelessly hit an enemy protected by a mythical class and be safe.

The blow shattered him to pieces.

But Masayuki doesn't care.

He ignored Feldway, who stepped back, caught off guard, and picked up Verglind.

"Masayuki?"

You're gonna be okay. Don't worry.

"Well, let's see, ......."

"I'll take care of the rest. Get some rest, Gryuen."

"Oh...!"

Tears spilled from Verglind's eyes.

It is a nickname from a loved one, and there is only one person in the world who knows it...

"Welcome back, Rudra!"

"Yeah. I'm back, but only for a little while."

Then Rudra, who resided in Masayuki, smiled.

From here, it was time to fight back.






*






Feldway furrows his brow in discomfort.

"Rudra?　What kind of nonsense is that?"

"Han!　Feldway, I'll take care of you, but it looks like the others are having a hard time as well. I'll give you a little help. Come on, Gran. You too, Damrada!"

As if in response to Rudra's call, time and space wavered.

"Two people were summoned there, completely ignoring the universal isolation ward.

"Oh dear. You spent beautiful days with Maria, but you're a rough master even after you're dead."

I'm sorry," complained the first man called, a blond with more than white hair.

He then cast his eagle-eyed gaze around and laughed.

"Hinata, my unworthy apprentice. It's a pity that you, the most talented of all the people I've worked with, have yet to become a hero.

Hinata was shocked when she thought of the name of the person who had spoken to her.

No way. You're .......

"I couldn't show you then, so now I'll show you by example. Let's see what you can do!"

"Master Grumbel?"

He was too young to be a master, but he was definitely Granbell Rosso. Granbell had returned to this land in his previous, most powerful form.

"Come, Longsword of Truth."

Granbell calls his beloved sword.

The long sword of true meaning, which had been stored in subspace, appeared in Granbell's hands without losing its mythical glow.

And the next moment.

The superb holy sword technique - the Shini Spiritual High Slash - carelessly sliced one of the evil dragon beasts and turned it into dust.

"No way. ......"

The victory of Granbell was so easy that it seemed to mock the struggles of Hinata and the others.






*






The man who had been called after Grambel knelt facing Rudra.

"Your Majesty, it is a great pleasure to awaken you from your long sleep!"

Rudra looked at Damrada in dismay.

"You're hard, Damrada. Do you have a personality like that?"

"I've missed you, my friend. You're the reason why I've been having such a hard time!

"Sorry. I don't remember. I don't know."

"Oh, right. That's the kind of guy you are!　I knew it!

Damrada was indignant, but hot tears were welling up in his eyes.

Don't cry. I'm sorry.

'Not really, but that's all right now. You kept your promise, so I'm happy."

Even after reincarnation, Rudra was still Rudra.

Rudra, to whom Damrada had pledged allegiance, had rejected the "demon king's" control of society and had set his sights on establishing a "unified nation" - a world where everyone could live happily in harmony. However, due to a series of tragedies, Rudra lost sight of his dream and his mind became worn out.

I regret the days when I was helpless to do anything for such a lord... but now.

The Rudra of the past was brilliantly manifested in a boy named Masayuki.

Damrada was satisfied just to see his master as he had been in the past.

Is that so?　I'm still in the middle of my dream..."

"Huh, if you don't give up, your dreams will come true, right?"

I would.

"Huh, that's just like Rudra-sama. Now that I've had my fill of long conversations, I can't lose to Gran, so I'd better get going.

Damrada, now with a fresh smile, breaks off the conversation with Rudra.

Then, with a hesitant gait, he stood next to Moss.

"The great demon that has tormented my empire for so long is unworthy."

"Tsk, I've got my own problems. ......

"Excuses?　Well, I'm not going to listen to them."

You're back to your old self.

"Of course. I've always been Rudra's friend and his loyal vassal. I can't help but cut a few corners while you're away."

We're not enemies now, though, are we?

Moss said, cowering lightly.

Laughing back at Moss, Damrada took a step forward.

Now, let's get this over with."

As soon as she said this, Damrada sank down and took a cat-legged stance. He put his weight on his right foot to become one with the earth, and then performed a "contraction" as if he were gliding across the ground. By a principle different from the ancient martial arts gait, Damrada's body moved forward like a cannonball.

And just like that, he crossed paths with the evil dragon beast...

"Holy supremacy!"

The part of the body that was struck transmitted the fighting spirit to the entire body. There was no way to block it, and it collapsed the spirit of the evil dragon beast.

I'm relieved to see you're as good as ever."

Moss complimented him in a very unpleasant way.

Then I guess it's your turn."

I know you will."

Moss agreed, sincerely disgusted.






*






Moss was reminded of his old troubles and bitter memories when he saw that his enemy was still alive and well, but for now he just had to do what he had to do.

Moss doesn't like to be defeated.

It would be fine if he could just lose, but he definitely did not want to be held responsible for it by his horrible boss.

That's the only thing I can't tolerate, so my main focus is on how to fight without losing.

This time, he had decided that he could not win immediately. That's why I was stalling for time, but if there was only one opponent, it would be a very different story.

If it was just one of us, we'd win.

While muttering this, he decided to show his serious mode for the first time in a long time. The minuscule "altered bodies" that had been scattered throughout the atmosphere were assembled and returned to their true form.

The man who appeared was a beautiful man with silver hair and blue eyes.

He is the second most powerful man after the Primordial. That's Moss.

As the main character Testarossa grows, Moss himself grows more powerful every day. The value of his existence exceeded the "1,079,397" that he had declared to Testarossa. "1,079,397" that he had declared to Testarossa, and now it had reached one and a half million.

In addition, in his hands were countless round moon rings - infinite rings.

At the same time that Moss was evolving, the Infinity Circle had also reached the mythical level. The value of the current Moss, which had completely taken in the power of the infinite circle, had reached two hundred and fifty thousand, surpassing the evil dragon beast.

If Moss were to get serious...

"You're going to die..."

As soon as Moss activated the technique, his body shook.

It becomes transparent, subdivides, and envelops the evil dragon beast.

"What the...?"

Looking at Moss with emotionless eyes, and then finding himself unable to move, the evil dragon beast was baffled by his inability to carry out his orders.

But it's only for a short time.

Moss's attack was a dark magic that used his own body as a medium, and it also had the characteristics of a technology with the effect of the unique skill "Gatherer". The effect was to absorb energy equal to his own.

In other words, the amount of magic element in Moss is directly converted into attack power, and although it has the disadvantage of not being able to be used again until the absorbed energy is sublimated, the strongest attack method at the moment is the "False Food Limitless Prison.

I can't use it in a crowded battle, because I know that if I use it, I will be useless for the time being. In other words, it is a technique that is difficult to handle and has almost no use, but in this case, it guaranteed an overwhelming victory for Moss.

"That's still a hell of a move. I wonder how many of my generals have been eaten."

I didn't use it much on the weak ones. Maybe he was in a hurry or something and had bad luck.　I don't want to hear from someone who uses a poison that corrupts the mind and even slaughters demons in the first place.

Tell me.

Damrada and Moss congratulated each other on their good work, in a way that seemed like they were undermining each other.






*






Thus, Moss also won.

And finally, the last one was Hinata, who was casually entrusted with the sword by Granbell.

"Master, this is ......."

"You can have it. You can have it, because it no longer means anything to me."

With that, Granbell handed over the long sword of his true intentions to Hinata.

.........

......

...

The Granbell here is nothing more than a fictional existence with substance. In fact, the sword he had just given to Hinata had been recreated and was now in his hand.

The ability to summon heroes from the past as a being of the same quality as the information life form. This was the true essence of the ultimate ability "King of Heroes" that Masayuki had awakened.

The Minute and Caligurio had regained their power because of the influence of this power.

And this time, let's see.

Masayuki's anger unknowingly triggered the Eitokon Doudou to become more powerful. And the one who was called upon was Rudra, the oldest and strongest hero.

The timing was also good.

Whether by chance or inevitably due to Masayuki's good fortune, ...... Michael's parallel existence was defeated by Chloe, and the information of the body that had been its substitute was on its way back to heaven. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.

The Masayuki of today has become an existence that is more about his ego as Rudra.

And Rudra was able to use Vergrind's authority as his own, at will.

Based on Vergrind's "Parallel Existence", he did the insane thing of giving the heroes summoned by the "Heroic Spirit Guidance" their first temporary bodies.

Granbell's new mythical long sword was also created by borrowing the power of Vergrind.

"You've taken the liberty of using my powers again, haven't you?"

Is that bad?

"No, not at all. Everything I have is yours, Rudra."

And, while they showed off their bromance without regret, what they were doing was horseshit.

In the event that you have any questions concerning where and how to use the internet, you can call us at the web site.

.........

......

...

"Be thankful. It's a divine sword given to me by Rudra Nazca, my master there. It's a divine sword given to me by my master, Rudra Nazca. And now that you have inherited it, let's see what you can do with it."

Grumbel commanded Hinata.

"My... ability?"

"Yes. I'll see if I'm worthy of holding the sword the heroes will inherit.

Granbell nodded hawkishly to Hinata, who was confused.

Now that she had been told that much, Hinata could not back down. In the first place, she had called herself the protector of humanity with a firm resolve, and she was not the kind of person who would hesitate at this point.

"Don't worry, then. The current me will not be defeated even by my master.

"How dare you talk so much when you're not even an old man? Don't forget that. It's the strength of your heart that makes you better. It's not the victory that matters. It's the better outcome that counts."

The words of Granbell, who acted for the future of humanity rather than for his own victory, were heavy.

Hinata chewed on it heavily.

Yes, I'm aware of that.

Just as he had entrusted his own "hope" to Chloe, Granbell entrusted his beliefs to Hinata.

Hinata took it in stride and looked forward.

The Evil Dragon Beast, the last of its kind, is in the eye of the beholder.

Hinata was surprised as she tried to focus her attention.

The more I looked at it, the more the surrounding situation filled my brain. The more I looked, the more the surrounding situation filled my brain.

The sword and will that had been entrusted to her were bringing about a change in Hinata.

The Longsword of True Meaning had recognized Hinata as his master and had unleashed his power to the fullest. As a result, the value of Hinata's existence was greatly increased.

And furthermore, Granbell's words washed away Hinata's worries.

Grambel said, "It's a pity that you haven't become a hero yet.

Paradoxically, this was a declaration that Hinata could become a "brave" person.

（Then I must live up to those expectations.)

The master, who had been more strict than anyone else, had accepted Hinata. His spirits were lifted.

I'll have you done in a moment."

and said a final goodbye to the evil dragon beast.

"True Spirit Supreme Slayer!"

He didn't even let his opponent know that he had been cut.

Countless slashes appeared on the body of the evil dragon beast, and at that moment, Hinata and I crossed our gazes.

"Bina ...... da ...... da zuke..."

The evil dragon beast was about to say something, but it was unspoken.

Before he could finish, his body was shredded and disintegrated.

Perhaps the remnants of Rainer's consciousness had asked Hinata for help, but if he had lost his essence as a human being to this stage, there was nothing he could do to save him.

It was Rainer's own fault, but...

"Good night. Sweet dreams.

Hinata said something to him.

I don't like Reiner for many reasons, and I don't think I could ever forgive him for what he did, but I hope he's at least at peace when he dies.

Thus, Hinata's victory was confirmed and the evil dragon beast was annihilated.


Granbell greeted Hinata with applause after her victory.

Brilliant."

No, it's because my master lent me his sword.

When Hinata tried to return the long sword of true meaning, Grumbel restrained her.

"It's yours now. I'm already dead. I'm already dead. I'm just a fake here, a perfect reproduction of my memories.

Such as ......."

It did not look very likely, but Hinata realized that this was the case.

"The boy who inherits my master's soul has created an extraordinary power."

Grumbel smiled as he said that.

Hinata agreed with him.

This was not resurrection from the dead, but it was an even more terrifying power if it was not done properly. It is possible to recreate heroes who are now in the past in their prime,.......

Even if it was limited to those who were involved with Masayuki, it was an incredible story. Moreover, there was a strong possibility that he could call out even those who were not involved.

At the very least, Granbell and Masayuki were not acquainted with each other. Even so, he was able to summon her because the "hero" Rudra, who is said to be from Masayuki's previous life, was Granbell's mentor.

It was as if even Hinata had just heard about it for the first time, and Masayuki knew nothing about it. In the first place, it was unclear how many people could be summoned at the same time, and it had to be said that it was an unfathomable power.

It may be natural that Granbell, who stands here with the authority of Masayuki, has no regrets about the sword he is leaving behind in this world. However, Hinata was not confident that she was worthy to hold it.

I understood that the Master was an illusion, but that was not the point. In the end, I could not become a hero. My qualifications have been passed on to Chloe, and unfortunately, there is no way that I will ever awaken..."

The "hero's egg" that Hinata carried had given birth to the strongest "hero" in Chloe. Therefore, the current Hinata would never awaken, and she could not meet the expectations of Granbell.

Knowing this, Hinata showed off her current self to Granbell.

There was a glimpse of Hinata's strong will that she did not mind being disappointed. She was declaring to her teacher, Granbell, that she had nothing to be ashamed of.

Granbell laughed at Hinata.

Do you really think so?"

"What...?"

It was my master Rudra's will that I was called, but I suppose it was inevitable. I remembered at the Promised Land that I could not entrust my will to you either. Maria was very angry with me.

The conversation itself is an illusion told by a fake.

It should have been, but it was so concrete and vivid.

Then Hinata learned the meaning of Grambel's words.

"What the...?　This power...

The qualification of the "hero" that Granbell had been carrying - the holy spirit of light that leads to victory - had been handed over to Hinata along with the long sword of true meaning.

That's all I have to say. Hinata, I leave the rest to you."

Grumbel said, and smiled a fresh smile that he had never shown before in his life.

Hinata swore by the smile on his face.

"Don't worry, Master. I will do my best."

Then good!"

Grumbel then gave her a small smile. Then she turned her back to Hinata, as if her business was finished.






*






Damrada lined up with Grunberg as he walked toward Masayuki.

Gran, are you done with your regrets?"

"Ah. I guess you could complain to Rudra, too."

"Well, he didn't listen to me, as usual.

It's just like him."

"Yeah, exactly."

The two of them seemed to get along very well as they exchanged such light words.

It made me think that this was the way it should have been before I was born, a long time ago.

No, it was the truth.

Granbell studied under Rudra and then parted company to bring the West together.

After the unification of the West, he was going to return to Rudra. ......

The game of wits with the monsters of power that control so many nations has exhausted Granbell to a great extent. The empire, which had been set up as a hypothetical enemy, soon became a real threat that troubled Granbell.

This is a great way to make sure that you are getting the most out of your time with your family and friends.

Those feelings of guilt were no longer relevant.

We could just laugh and talk to each other, just like the old days.

It was definitely not a trick that a mere illusion could pull off.

Rudra awaits the two of them.

"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

"I was complimenting you."

"Yeah, yeah. We can't do anything without you."

"Shit, he's gonna throw up. Well, that's okay. It's my turn now, so get some rest until I call you back."

Rudra laughs.

Granbell and Damrada laughed back, and then disappeared. They left, satisfied that their turn had come to an end.

Rudra, who was left in charge of the rest of the team, accepted the trust from the two men without hesitation.

Rudra, are you okay?"

He smiled at the worried Verglind and hugged her around the waist, even kissing her lightly.

You don't have time for this.

"Well, I'll be gone when it's over. I just got my reward first."

Verglind stared at Rudra in ecstasy.

I love the simple and innocent Masayuki, but Rudra, the man I once loved, is something else.

One day, Masayuki would become Rudra himself. Velgrind had believed that, but he never thought that his dream would come true.

It was a contradiction, but it was the truth.

Because any Rudra can be loved, the original is the best - and Masayuki, who recreated such a Rudra, became the supreme being for Verglind.

The word "love" is no longer enough.

"I love you, Masayuki. I love you, Rudra.

I know. And don't say that word to me, say it to Masayuki himself.

But she's so shy."

"I'm sure he's happy inside. That's what I'm saying."

Yes, the words were true as well.

The Rudra of today is not an illusion, but the man himself, Masayuki, who carries the memories of Rudra.

Rudra then turned to Feldway as if to hide his embarrassment.

Well, thanks for waiting, Feldway.

"......, it looks like you're the real deal. Do you think you've transcended death by ignoring the laws of this world?"

"No. I'm still dead, and there is no going back to heaven. But you know, you can hit a man from the other side if he makes the woman you love cry."

Don't be silly.

I'm serious.　Well, I haven't gone to the other side yet.

Although he said it in a funny way, this statement of Rudra's was quite true.

That's why it is inhabited by Masayuki, and since Michael's body is still incarnate, not all of his memories have been recreated.

As soon as the effect of Masayuki's power wears off, Rudra's "personality" will disappear. However, his memories and experiences will remain stored in Masayuki's mind.

This meant that Rudra could continue to manifest. I'm not so sycophantic as to tell you that, but I'm Rudra, and I'm not trying to hide it.

"Well, and..."

Muttering this, Rudra glanced at Vega.

Then he turned to Testarossa and Hinata and gave them a look of obvious command.

"Oh, boys. I'll take care of the mooks over there."

Naturally, they were repulsed.

"Great, ......."

I agree.

But it was in their best interest to follow Rudra's lead here, and they were not so stupid as to not understand that.

That's why I feel the quality is even worse, but I'll choose to follow the path quietly in this situation.

"Shall we have a common front, Hinata-dono?"

"Yes, Miss Testarossa. I'm glad you're my partner, so I don't have to worry."

"Hmmm, me too."

Thus, an impromptu duo was formed to take on Vega.

Vega vs. Testarossa & Hinata.

And...

Feldway vs. Rudra.

The final battle in King's Landing was about to begin.






*






Two beautiful women stand in front of Vega.

Testarossa smiled bewitchingly, while Hinata smiled coldly.

I'm going to finish him off, so why don't you take care of him for a while?"

"Yes, that's fine. It seems that it is difficult to kill with a sword, and widespread annihilation magic cannot be used in the capital, so let's divide up the roles.

As a group of smart people, it was easy for us to come to an agreement.

Testarossa stepped back and began to search for the area of influence of the power that Vega had activated. It's easy to neglect this when you're fighting, but this time, she activated her detection spell carefully in order to really get to the bottom of it.

Then Hinata stood in front of Vega.

Oh, hey, what happened to Damrada's husband and the other bastard?"

I'm home.

"Hmm, I see. You looked like you were going to do some work, but you're not my enemy. Neither are you. You seem to have gotten carried away just because you were able to defeat my evil dragon beast, but I'm going to teach you a lesson about reality.

Vega showed Hinata how much he cared about her.

As a former colleague, Damrada felt that he was quite capable. However, he thinks that the current Vega is not an enemy and does not regard him as such a threat.

Even so, Hinata's words that she was back made him honestly happy, because he felt annoyed when he was swarmed by the strong people of that class.

Well, it's less of a hassle.

"Well, what do you think?　Don't underestimate me, or you'll regret it."

Even the quintessential Hinata could see that Vega was an incredibly strong person. Normally, she would agitate him from above, but she understood that it would be ridiculous for Hinata to make such a statement now.

The right thing to do here is to win and show your ability.

As soon as the exchange was over, Vega moved.

He chose to use his greatly increased strength and speed to twist Hinata around head-on.

Vega's stiff arm destroys objects with a shockwave without even touching them. The same goes for his kicks. His entire body had become an incarnation of destruction that surpassed that of strategic weapons, and he was causing uncommon damage to his surroundings.

If it weren't for the "barrier of universal isolation," the royal capital would have been burnt to ashes in a matter of minutes. Hinata, exposed to such violence, would normally have been in great trouble.

In fact, Hinata's existence value has also increased significantly, but Vega's rate of increase was even greater. He was an opponent with more than ten times the difference, and he even possessed the ultimate ability.

Even though she was able to awaken as a "hero" thanks to Granbell, Vega was still too dangerous for Hinata.

And yet, Hinata was not upset.

（It's strange. I'm not scared at all. And for some reason, I can read the flow of attacks...)

It was more accurate than the "prediction of future attacks" that Rimuru had mastered - it was now so accurate that it could be called "prediction of the future".

It's no wonder that Hinata's current ability is...


Confirmed. The unique skill "Mathematician" has successfully evolved into the ultimate ability "King of Mathematics" ......》.


With Hinata's own evolution, she had reached the ultimate realm.

This "King of Oddities" includes the following powers: thought acceleration, universal sensing, divine supremacy, time and space manipulation, multi-dimensional boundaries, all things in the universe, arithmetic domain, and virtual world.

By making full use of these tools, Hinata was able to embody almost complete "future prediction".

It is because of this ability that I was able to master the sword technique of Granbell, the "True Spiritual High Slash".

Hinata had lost her unique skill, "Usurper," but she had made the "King of Oddities" her own with such talent that she did not need it.

Hinata was able to see through all of Vega's tricky attacks, such as altering her body and branching her arms. Even when Vega was several times faster than her, Hinata was able to toss her around without any trouble.

You're fucking all over the place!

It's a good thing that I'm not the only one who has a problem with this. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for. However, Hinata now had the long sword of true meaning in her hand.

In the past, it would have been difficult to even pass it off properly considering the difference in weapon performance, but with the long sword of true intent, there was no need to worry about that. When combined with Hinata's calculations - "future prediction" - it was possible to pass Vega's attack head-on.

The difference in strength was too great and the angle needed to be adjusted, but with Hinata's skill, it was easy.

No luck, huh?

"Goddamn it!　But even you don't have the means to attack me!

Vega shouted that he was losing, and he was right.

However, Hinata had no reason to be ashamed of this.

After all, that's what Testarossa was waiting for.

It would be very helpful to have a good vanguard. We're ready for you."

I'll ask you then."

"Yes. You don't need to do penance, so go to purgatory."

Vega, with his survival instincts, sensed that he was in trouble.

Don't be silly!　No, wait!　Wait for me...

It was not Testarossa who listened to Vega's pleas for his life.

"The White Blazing Flame..."

The ultimate in human magic, created by Testarossa with his ultimate ability, the King of the Deadly Realm, is the "White Flash Flame Supreme".

It eats away at life, and it reaps away. It eats and reaps life. There is no escape for those who are designated as the target, and their bodies will be burned by the white flames, and they will be thrown into hell.

It is a terrifying magic that does not cause any damage to the surrounding area, but its power - the amount of heat - lightly surpasses that of the nuclear bombardment magic.

If Vega was hit by this, he would be burned to the ground in an instant.

But Testarossa's expression was dark.

"This sucks. I think I messed up."

He muttered to himself, gravely.

Hinata overheard this and asked.

What does that mean?"

"I couldn't reap that fool's soul. You can't fool my eyes, or anyone else's."

When Vega died, Testarossa was given a massive "soul". When Vega died, Testarossa got a massive "soul," but it didn't smell like Vega's.

Hinata thought.

(That magic was of a horrible nature. Even I would find it hard to bear. And yet, how could I escape?)

If it were me, I would definitely be defeated the moment the magic was activated. Hinata was sure of this, but remembering Vega's attitude, she retracted her theory.

It's possible, or rather, almost certain, that he got away.

You think so too?

"Yeah. Because that guy seemed to be acting."

"Yes. That begging for his life wasn't desperate enough or sneaky enough."

Testarossa had heard a lot of reports from Moss about how despicable this Vega guy was. If he knew he was at a disadvantage, he would immediately pull the trigger.

I could have sworn that such a man did not think he would die when he did not stop looking up to the end.

"This sucks. I'm so embarrassed, I don't think I'll be able to face Lord Rimuru. ......"

Testarossa writhes in shame at his mistake.

And Hinata, too.

"Oh, I can just see the look on Rimuru's face when he's happy to hear that. Apparently, he's very happy when I fail. ......"

And, this one has a head start on this one.

He had just met her with a look that said he was always right, and Rimuru was very happy when Hinata was in trouble.

Hinata felt both annoyed and happy that she could rely on him, which gave her mixed feelings.


Moss, who had been listening to the conversation of these women heroes, thought while remaining as silent as the air.

I thought, "If I do this, I'll be tormented for three hundred years.

I was too afraid to report that I had let the enemy escape.

But Moss was not foolish enough to point out his boss's mistake here.

He knew deep down that if he did that, he would be blamed for why he hadn't been watching.

(Oh, I'm sure Testarossa-sama will have a rough time if the other executives blame him. ......)

It was a depressing moth, anticipating that his boss would be in a bad mood for the time being.

At least, he secretly hoped that it would not be directed at him.






*






Rudra leisurely took off his imperial coat and left it with Verglind.

He became shirtless and looked at Feldway.

"Come on, Earth God..."

The sword Rudra used when he was a "hero" was the one that answered his call.

It was a divine treasure sword given to Rudra by his friend and teacher, Vedanava.

The grade of the sword is the highest of the Mythic grade. The "Heavenly Demon" and the "Earthly God" are a pair, and it is the strongest sword that can boast that nothing can surpass it.

The "Heavenly Demon," which Gee had given to Milim, was a long, curved, single-edged sword, while the "Earth God" was a normal-sized, double-edged sword. Its ease of use made it a perfect match for Rudra.

Feldway narrows his eyes.

"That sword is Lord Verdunava's ......."

"Yes, of course. I'm the one who got it."

"...... is unforgivable. It is too precious to be wasted on mere mortals."

I don't give a shit.

Rudra walked towards Feldway as he responded in a huff.

Verglind looks on with concern, but doesn't want to interfere. He believes in Rudra.

"Well, you're still a coward, aren't you? You're still a coward. You're the type of person who would never use all your strength to decide between a man and a woman.

"What does it matter?　A chief must survive longer than anyone else. You know this as well as I do."

"Well, yeah. But if you miss out on a winnable battle because of it, then you're missing the point, right?

"What are you..."

I'm grateful to you. If you hadn't relied on the King of Justice and fought Gryuen on your own, he would have been much more severely injured.

......"

"But I won't forgive you for hurting him. Prepare yourself!"

When he finished saying that, Rudra was in close contact with Feldway. He then swung his sword carelessly.

Feldway takes this in stride.

That sword, like Rudra's and Guy's, is also a gem named "Emptiness" that Feldway received from Verdunava.

The quality of the sword is the same. It is the skill that determines the outcome.

The ground shattered with the stomp of his foot, and even the atmosphere cracked with the impact of his running through the air. The impact of the swords clashing was tremendous, and the smell of burning air filled the surroundings.

That's awesome. ......

Hinata, who was now a member of the audience, muttered.

As Hinata's teacher, Granbell, respected her as a master, Rudra's power was real. Even though he was inhabiting the fragile body of Masayuki, his power was on par with Feldway's.

No, it was more than that.

After several rounds of striking, it was Feldway who was outmatched.

You're weak, you know that?

"Don't you dare, Rudra!"

"That's what happens when you rely too much on your authority. You're trying to imitate me, but I'm not so naive.

Rudra's sword bounced off Feldway's sword as he said this.

What was there was an overwhelming difference in ability.

I've been using it for a long time. I've been using it for a long time, so I'm sure of it."

......"

But while you're activating it, you can't attack at all, right?　You can't use magic, you can't use any other powers, you can't even use your fighting spirit. But you know..."

A loophole exists.

Even though it was impossible to make his fighting spirit fly, overpowering him with his supreme energy was effective. And, although this was the real deal, it was possible to attack with hand-held weapons without any problem.

Rudra was proficient in this.

With his extreme skill, he was even able to perform unusual techniques such as "lifting the Royal Citadel only at the moment of slashing, and increasing the power through the fighting spirit.

I'm sure you're aware of that, so you thought you were in a one-sided position, but that's a strategy that worked for me. If you're not the most skilled with a sword, you can easily lose your means of attack like this.

He had hit the nail on the head.

Feldway knew this, as he had served in Rudra's inner circle.

Therefore, when he acquired the ultimate ability "King of Justice", he tried to recreate that technique, but it was not so easy.

This is not a skill that Rudra learned overnight, but a method of combat that he learned over and over again while being beaten by his master, Verdunava.

Besides, losing in swordplay does not mean that the Royal Citadel has been defeated.

Feldway was still intact and had not lost his overall advantage.

"Well, I concede your point. But don't think that you've won."

Feldway told him arrogantly.

He is absolutely confident in his own defense and believes that he will not be defeated. However, as if to mock such Feldway, Rudra replies.

"You really think you've got me figured out, don't you? How many years do you think I've spent with Verdunava since he entrusted me with the King of Justice?

What's your point?"

I'm asking you if you think I didn't think of that strategy.

"Fool. You think there's any way to defeat the most powerful of all ultimate powers, the angelic one?　You can't bluff your way through me."

Rudra only snickered when he was told that.

Then he narrowed his eyes and thrust his sword at Feldway.

I'll tell you. What I got was the King of Pledges, what do you think his characteristics are?"

"It's just a power for management purposes. In creating his many powers, Lord Vardanava used the Oathkeeper to keep track of them.

Asked by Rudra, Feldway replied.

It was the right answer, but it did not express the whole truth.

That's not all, is it? As you may know, the Covenant King also had the ability to listen to the voices of the people. The voices of the people, or rather, the voices of those who are related to the Verdunavas. It can be a wish for hope, a prayer for salvation, or any number of other desires, and when I got it, it didn't lose its power.

It's ......, so what?"

See the resemblance?　The 'King of Justice' power you're using now."

As long as he is loyal to his owner, the Royal Citadel is invincible. In other words, the "King of Pledges" and the "King of Justice" have similar powers in the sense that they listen to the "voices" of those who are connected to them.

In addition to the fact that it's a very good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for, it's also a very good idea to have a good idea of what you're looking for.

Rudra grinned as he told me this.

He lightly swung the "Earth God" in his hand, making the blade glow with light.

You can see it.

"Mumu. ......"

Feldway's complexion changed when he saw the light.

I knew at a glance that it had the same properties as the "royal citadel" that I was wearing.

The more people who believe in me, the more power I have. How many of your followers do you have?　I have over a billion people counting on me!

Rudra's words are true.

The total number of subordinates who believe in Feldway is less than a million. The number of people who believe in Feldway is less than one million, and it has been greatly reduced to less than 300,000 now.

In contrast, the number of people who believed in Rudra reached 800 million among the subjects of the empire alone.

Here in the royal capital of Ingrassia alone, millions of people had placed their hopes in Rudra. It was actually their feelings for Masayuki, but since they were both the same person, they could accept it without any problem.

Rudra and Feldway, there was a huge gap in the absolute number of people supporting both of them. Feldway's face twisted in frustration as he realized this.

"This is the killing blow that unites the will of those who believe in me... 'Absolute Dismemberment'!"

It's dangerous... Feldway can see that.

"Don't be silly!　How can you use the power of the Pledge King?　It's still missing..."

When Vedanava died, the King of Pledges should have been lost. And yet, Rudra is using it as a matter of course.

It was an unacceptable situation.

"You're not paying attention, are you? You're not paying attention. If you're saying that, Gran's probably using the King of Hope too.

Rudra tells us, "I'm really puzzled.

Masayuki's "King of Heroes" can recreate even the powers that have disappeared. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.

He really doesn't like to play games.

Verglind was also dismayed, but more than that, he was in love with Rudra's bravery, and in the end, no one was paying attention except Rudra's sister Lucia. This was the scene that had been repeated in the past, and it was being recreated exactly now.

"Then you are..."

I can use the King of Justice right now. I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.

"What the...?"

Feldway was on full alert, mobilizing not only the Royal Citadel but also all of his own wards in a defensive posture.

And right after that...

I've been waiting for you. Let's see how long you can hold out and show some guts!"

With Rudra's voice, the ultimate blow was unleashed.

"This isn't going to work, Rudra...!"

"The Star King's Dragon Flash."

The crossing is instantaneous.

A terrifying rampage of destruction erupted on the spot.

The all-isolation wards were meaningless. Even though Vergrind had contained the main shockwave and sent it skyward, it was shattered in the aftermath.

This is not the kind of power that comes from swordplay, but this is what makes Rudra Rudra.

This unreasonable strength was the ability of the "hero of the beginning" to compete with Gee.

And of course, it was Feldway who fell.

Well, that's a fair result."

Rudra laughs briskly and raises his right hand to the sky to show it.

It was an unmistakable declaration of victory.






*






Feldway falls to his knees and vomits blood.

The blood was crimson and dyed the pure white robe of the god.

"Ba, stupid, this is me. ......"

"You're conceited, Feldway. You've always been so conceited, Feldway, but you've always been the best at everything you do. That's why you lose sight of your true nature.

I'm not going to let you get away with it.

You're right. That's why I understand some of the things you're saying."

The winner and the loser fell silent and stared at each other for a while.

Feldway was the next to move.

"There will be no next time. Today's defeat is your last."

He then stood up as if the injury he had just sustained had never existed in the first place.

If it weren't for the crimson flowers that bloomed on his clothes, he would have thought that he had received Rudra's sword as an illusion.

"Stubborn as ever, I see. Well, no matter how many times you come back, I'll always win, so do what you want."

Their gazes exchanged once more, and then separated.

Feldway turned his back on Rudra and ordered Mai, who was waiting at a distance, to disappear from the scene with an "instantaneous movement.

"It was impossible to stop him from escaping, because not only the isolation ward of all things, but also the "ward" of the royal capital had been destroyed.

However, it was a good decision not to pursue it.

Despite his injuries, Feldway still had a lot of strength left in him.

Although he was mentally cornered due to his defeat by Rudra, his fighting ability was still sufficient. If it hadn't been for the defeat of the Royal Citadel, which boasted of being invincible, he would not have chosen to flee so easily.

Feldway vowed to take revenge on Rudra so that he would never forget the humiliation of today.


Now, as for the victorious Rudra...

"Way to go, Rudra!"

He pressed his face into Verglind's chest, and he didn't seem to be full of it.

No, not if you look closely.

He blushed, his eyes black and white.

It wasn't Rudra anymore - it was back to Masayuki.

I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but I think it's a good idea. This was also the reason why he had missed Feldway.

Rather, he had simply maintained his Rudra persona with his guts until Feldway left.

Hinata walked up to Masayuki, who had been freed from Verglind.

Nice to meet you, Mr. Hajime. My name is Hinata Sakaguchi. Before you leave, I thought I'd say a few words..."

In the middle of Hinata's greeting, he began to hear the noise of the people.

He was excited to see how strong Rudra was, and that Masayuki was getting serious.

It was a misunderstanding, but for those who were unaware of the situation, it was the truth. They had sensed that the battle was over and had come running to the ground.

As soon as they were within a certain distance of each other, they formed a circle around Masayuki. This was the result of the Minute's initiative to hold back the people.

"You're so cool, Masayuki!"

I've never seen that before. I've never seen a flash of light like this.

"Yeah. I had no idea what was going on, but I could tell it was awesome!"

And so, naturally, the credit goes to Masayuki.

Because Reiner and the others had been able to see the video, many people in the capital had witnessed the whole thing.

(No, no, no, that's not me!)

No, it's me, but..." Masayuki's inner heart was in turmoil. However, he invoked his natural through-skill and succeeded in making a face that said, "Of course, but what?　He succeeded in making up for it with an expression that said, "Of course, but what?

How on earth did this happen?　was Masayuki's untrue feeling at the moment.

From Masayuki's point of view, everything was done by Rudra on his own. Even though he was told that it was great, he didn't really feel it.

It was hard to accept his praise honestly, as it seemed like he was just another person, but the people didn't understand how Masayuki felt.

"Good work. You looked good, Masayuki."

Velgrind handed him a jet-black, gold-embroidered emperor's robe, and he put it on as he pondered. He was embarrassed to be the focus of the public's attention, but he also had a hint of danger in the air.

To be more specific, the Knights of the Royal Capital had arrived.

(Wow, that's going to be some trouble. ......)

As Masayuki's bodyguard, Minute is acting as a negotiator. He seems to be refusing the Emperor's request for an audience, telling him to talk to us first.

I listened, thinking that I could count on him, but the content of the conversation was very disturbing.

It sounded like the king had been assassinated, but it should have nothing to do with Masayuki. Yet, when he heard something about an important witness, his heart kept pounding.

Having gone through a lot of hardships, he thought that he was now able to accept any hardships naturally... but now he realizes that this was an exaggeration.

Although he had gotten used to the nervousness of standing in front of people, Masayuki was still a bit of a novice.

In addition, I'd like to see a murder charge. ......

I'm sorry. It seems I've gotten you involved in our situation."

When Hinata noticed that he had returned from Rudra to Masayuki, she quietly apologized to him.

What?"

"Rainer murdered King Aegir and blamed me for it."

No way, thought Masayuki.

（That's a big deal!)

It was difficult to be involved in such an incident and agree that it was okay. But it was also impossible to pretend not to be involved now.

I want to complain, but I have no one to complain to.

After all, Masayuki was the most important person in this place.

Having no choice, Masayuki decided to take care of the situation.

As the crowd cheered loudly, Masayuki took a step forward.

Then, as he always practiced, he tilted his head at an angle and looked down.

After a two-second pause, he turned his face to the front and looked at the people.

I could feel the excitement level of the people rising just from that. It was frighteningly effective.

(It's just like Limuru taught me, you know.)

Yes.

Masayuki's current gesture was the result of Rimuru's guidance - or rather, practice based on Ciel's production.

The effect of the ability was increased by the addition of a gesture that was calculated to win the hearts of the people. In addition, now that he had evolved into the "King of Heroes", the effect was enormous.

"Everyone, please calm down. Stay calm and tell me what's going on..."

When Masayuki began to speak quietly, the excited people quieted down at once.

Quietly, like a receding wave, the place was enveloped in silence.

The influence was even greater than he had imagined, and Masayuki was inwardly terrified.

This is the effect of just a little bit of acting instruction.

With nothing to do but laugh at the current situation, Masayuki reopened his eyes and continued his performance.

(Um, don't panic, take your time. If you stutter or bite a little, don't worry, you'll be compensated!　(Wasn't it?)

Since he decided to become the emperor of the empire, Rimuru has consulted with him many times. There are many other people who support Masayuki, and now he is able to act accordingly. The people who are looking at him in a passionate way have no idea that Masayuki is actually nervous.

"Ladies and gentlemen!　What's right and what's wrong? What's right and what's wrong is obvious from this scene. If you are wise, you will have realized the right answer without me saying anything. Please believe in that answer. And I want to believe in you, too!

I don't know if I can say it myself, but I don't think it explains anything," said Masayuki. However, he was still convinced that it was quite effective.

Because that is the effect of Masayuki's "King of Heroes".

I don't know what the right thing to do is, but at least I want to avoid antagonizing the people. It seemed that he was succeeding in doing so, and he decided to take advantage of the opportunity to lead the people in a cunning manner so as not to be taken advantage of.

(It's perfect. I didn't say anything important, so I can't be blamed if I'm wrong.)

I'm really proud of myself," Masayuki said to himself inwardly.

As Masayuki began to speak, the people who had been making a lot of noise quieted down at once. With that, the Minute came up to Masayuki with a knight.

He was a large man with a stern face and metal armor all over his body.

Masayuki is scared.

The knight, however, made a superlative salute to Masayuki.

"It is my great pleasure to have an audience with His Majesty Masayuki, the hero of the Kingdom of Ingrassia and the great Emperor of the Empire!

Oh, yes.

Masayuki nodded her head in agreement.

However, he was inspired to say what needed to be said and opened his mouth to the knight.

"Well, King Aegir..."

I heard that she was killed, but the murderer was not Hinata... I was about to continue, but the knight interrupted me and started talking.

"Don't worry!　I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to get rid of it.　In other words, if we are knights of Ingrassia, there is no way that we can doubt you, Hinata-dono!

Then the knight laughed in high spirits.

So, have they identified the killer?"

Hinata glanced at Prince Elric as she said this.

He had been hiding and shivering behind the fountain ever since the battle started, but Moss had moved him out of the way halfway through.

It was not a kindness, but an instruction from Testarossa.

They had no intention of letting him go.

In such a situation, anyone with an eye for detail would be able to guess who was behind it.

It seems to be true that the king was murdered, but is Hinata really the culprit?

These are the questions that come to people's minds.

It was clear that Prince Elric was a popular man, but the whole situation was self-evident.

Masayuki had no idea what was going on, but Hinata caught her and turned her attention to Prince Elric. At that moment, he looked up and met Elric's eyes.

'Huh-ha-ha-ha ....... It's over, I'm ruined. ......"

Elric suddenly started laughing as Masayuki looked at him.

Then, for some reason, he took the liberty of confessing his own misdeeds.

(No, what?　I don't know what's going on here, but what the hell is going on?)

Elric, who mistakenly thought he had seen through everything, just blew himself up on his own. Masayuki didn't know that, but she decided to hide her inner turmoil and continue acting like she knew everything.

The situation then comes to a head in a furious turn of events.

It looks like Masayuki-sama has identified the culprit and solved your problem. ......

"How dare Prince Elric murder his father, the King? ......"

The mastermind behind this is Reiner, the former Commander of the Order."

"So, Hinata-sama went to ......."

"Reiner was the hapless bastard who blundered at the council meeting, wasn't he?"

"Oh, the disgraced ex-General of the Knights of Ingrassia."

"So now you've decided to take revenge on Hinata-sama by borrowing the power of a monster?"

But the one who saw through that and saved Hinata-sama's life was our Masayuki-sama!

You're the brave one!"

You've become the Emperor of the Empire, but you still remember us!

The prince's confession was decisive.

Even without any explanation from Masayuki or Hinata, the people were convinced on their own.

"Long live Masayuki-sama!"

"Glory to our Lord Masayuki!"

This is a natural occurrence.

It quickly spread through the crowd, and then the chorus began.


"Ma~sayuki, ma~sayuki...!"


And it wasn't long before King's Landing was filled with the usual loud cheers.

With one hand raised awkwardly and his cheek twitching, Masayuki responds to the people.

The contrast between Hinata, who looked a little dumbfounded, and Verglind, who looked satisfied, was stark.

Masayuki's insides were filled with tears and the thought, "Anything is possible now! But that's the way it always is.

By the way, the next day, due to the after-effects of carrying Rudra and various other reasons, Masayuki was tormented by a horrible pain that consumed his entire body, which was not connected to any recovery magic - a very rare kind of growing pains called "soul pains" - but there was no way for him to know that now. But there was no way for him to know that now.






◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇






Mikael was painfully aware of his own naivety.

To be honest, at first I thought that the Demon Lord Rimuru was an insignificant existence. That thought changed when Rimuru defeated Verglind.

From then on, he regarded them as enemies and took extra precautions. Even so, he still thought that he could not be an enemy in a head-on fight.

Michael had to admit here that he had been naive in his perception.

After all, the Demon Lord Rimuru had entered the "Stopped World", a place that only a limited number of people are allowed to enter, without permission.

（He's a pain in the ass. He's always getting in my way.)

At this point, there was no point in stopping time anymore.

Mikhail decides to unlock the Time Stop and use his overwhelming power to crush Rimuru. The "Time Stop" that he obtained by analyzing the "King of Patience", which is Velzarde's authority, is meaningless to someone who can control the "Informant" at will. If he maintained it, he would only be wasting energy, so he decided it would be more advantageous to fight in a straightforward manner.

In fact, Mikhail's body had been strengthened to the point of invincibility, and he was full of energy. His body had been strengthened to the point of invincibility, and he was full of energy.

That's not all.

Michael, as befits the head of the angelic ultimate ability, is able to exercise all the powers he has analyzed and taken in without regret.

From Velzard's "King of Patience," the concept of "fixation" provides a powerful and unmatched defensive ability. It's not as good as the Royal Citadel, but it's more useful in that it can be used to launch attacks at the same time. In addition, the concept of "fixation" has led to the ultimate "time stop". As long as he had this, it seemed that he would never be defeated by any being.

Another example is Vergrind's "King of Helping Hands," which boasts the ultimate in offensive performance.

The information about the "King of Purity" that we had collected from Leon was also very useful in terms of energy efficiency.

Even the powers that he lent to his subordinates were at his disposal. He can manipulate them at will, just as he did with Arios's "King of Punishment" to "hide" them.

Michael, who had reached such a level of existence, had no doubt that he would win the war no matter what the situation was, as long as he was present.

He had been defeated by the brave Chloe, but that was only a parallel existence, less than 20%. The current Mikael is at full strength and has already replenished the lost energy.

In fact, there was a disparity of more than ten times between the Demon King Rimuru and Mikael in front of him. It was a situation where he could say with certainty that there was nothing to lose.


To begin with, a serious Mikael would have easily buried Obera's army. If you think about it, defeating Rimuru personally should have been a piece of cake.

However, it was not that simple.

This guy is a monster, Mikael admitted from the bottom of his heart.

All kinds of attacks aimed at Rimuru would not work.

In a matter of seconds, even the accelerated excitation of the scorching heat of the dragon's supremacy, which was released with the intent to kill, was drowned out.

Michael could not believe his eyes.

As soon as he lost his overwhelming advantage of stopping time, he had no effective means of attack against Rimuru. When he realized this, it was as if the victory or defeat had already been decided.

"Hmm, all these attacks are easy to understand. This is more than I can deal with..."

As soon as he thought he had muttered something, Limuru's threat level increased several notches.

The color of his eyes glowed gold.

When that happened, Rimuru was no longer a match for Mikhail.

If not attack, then defend?

Michael's "Royal Citadel" was no longer effective, but the "King of Patience" obtained from Velzard was. Its essence is "fixation," and it boasts absolute defense.

With that in mind, he activated the "Snow Crystal Shield" to coagulate the moisture in the atmosphere. Pouring all of his strength into it, he stretched it around the entire circumference to envelop Mikhail himself as an object that could not be destroyed by anything.

But, but.

"Oh, you can eat this too?　Seriously?"

For some reason, Rimuru himself was surprised and made a hole in the "snow crystal shield".

It was an unbelievable reality.

What did you do?　What the hell did you just do?

Mikhail couldn't help but exclaim, .......

Rimuru replies flatly.

I ate it.

"Ate"?

"Well, yeah. That's what I'm entitled to. Well, I didn't think I could eat 'warding' or anything, but I guess you can if you try."

It can't be, Mikael thought in astonishment.

I felt like screaming out, "What are you talking about?

Mikhail is acting on the basis of rational judgment. That's why he can't nod his head in agreement to such irrational talk.

But it was all about results.

Michael is not so incompetent as to ignore the reality in front of him.

Now, what should we do?

All means of attack were disabled, and all means of defense were lost.

A calm voice whispered that we should run.

At the same time, some people thought that we should explore the information here.

Either way, Mikael has a 'parallel existence', so even if he is defeated here, he can be revived.

That's why he had transferred his authority to Feldway, so it was possible to attack him, even if it was reckless.

But...

The Demon Lord Rimuru was too impenetrable.

And Mikhail's escape route had been blocked long ago.


I've trapped this area in 'imaginary space'. Now it's impossible for Mikael to escape from this place.


I thought I heard a voice that I didn't know who it was.

I thought that was ridiculous, but apparently it was true.

So, there is only one answer to this question, without having to worry about it.

If we can't defeat the Demon Lord Rimuru here, we have no way out either way.

"Then I will respond. Know my true intentions."

Michael declared, and tried to summon the strongest sword he could find, not the one in his hand.

"Come, Earth God."

But there was no response.

Since Rudra, the real owner, was using it, there was no way he would respond to the call of Michael, who was only the master of the fake.

If he had been able to use Parallel Existence like Verglind, he would have been able to understand the world he was seeing through Feldway's eyes. However, although Mikael had transferred the function as a right, he was not able to synchronize it completely.

The reason for this failure was that I thought it would be no problem to exchange information later.

I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.

Rimuru's reaction was, "What? But he was ready to respond with his sword.

Um, what's this thing called the Earth God?

Don't worry about it.

That's all well and good, but ......"

Rimuru looked a little unconvinced, but his expression tightened as Mikhail's divinity increased.

Then, both men went to the final game.

"The Demon Lich King."

Mikhail had taken over Rudra's body, and he had made the sword techniques his own. It was impossible for the current Mikael to recreate Rudra's most powerful technique, the "Star King Dragon Flash," but he was fully capable of handling the most powerful sword techniques for manipulating spirit children.

"I'm also very good at disintegrating spirit children, and I've chosen to use a superb holy sword technique for this game.

Limuru, on the other hand, showed his inner hand without any hesitation.

"Falsehoods, Oblivion, and a Thousand Transformations."

As if it were a courtesy to those who are dying, they are generously shown to the public for the first time.

It was a formidable feat.

The trajectory of the sword changes in thousands and thousands of ways, slicing through the enemy with elusive movements. The power of the sword is impeccable, turning the target into dust and scattering it like a flower.

It was not in the realm of human beings, and it seemed impossible even for the Demon Lord to reach.

The strength of the dragon species and the flexibility of the slime must have combined to create this mysterious sword technique.

"I'm losing ......."

Mikhail realized that his body was disintegrating.

And without the time to face that inevitable reality...

Now, do you have anything left to say?"

Rimuru asked me.

Accepting his defeat, Michael thinks.

How could I have lost when I outperformed them in every possible way?

I didn't get an answer to that question.

That's why I ask a different question instead of a sore loser.

Who are you, ......?"

Limuru then replied with a scowl.

"Oh, me?　I'm just a slime. ......"

What are you talking about, Mikhail thought, suddenly feeling ridiculous.

For some reason, I was so unconcerned with my crumbling body...

（Maybe this is what it feels like to be pleasant?)

I suddenly understood that.

The Lord abandoned me, my ego grew, and I've never felt anything like it since. I had tried to imitate it, but I had dismissed it as something I could not understand. ......

And yet, at the last moment, I suddenly understood.

It's just not right, Mikael thought to himself.

"What is slime? You're a freakish existence that I can't even understand, and yet you're so appropriate. You've defeated me, the nucleus of divinity..."

Decay rate increased.

Like particles of light dispersing, more and more of my body was being chipped away.

Actually, you know, I'm not alone.

"What...?"

Take your time about that, ask my buddy."

With that, Rimuru broke off the conversation.

And then his hand was on Mikael's...

"Eat all things... 'God of the Void'..."

For the first time in this world, the ultimate and most powerful power has bared its fangs.

The power of peace that no one can resist - the "Soul Eater" - has swallowed up all of Michael.

.........

......

...

The truth is, I understood.

He said that He, the Creator, had abandoned Himself.

He didn't want to admit it, so he had been struggling with it until now.

But that's all over now.

It was warm there, and everything was full.

A nostalgic sense of comfort.

Oh, I see... Mikael thought as he faded away.

Maybe it was all a misunderstanding.

It was all here, and I felt myself becoming a part of it.

Mikhail is no longer alone.

It was inevitable that this would happen, and it was probably a planned event.


Oh, ......, my wish has been granted. Feldway, the only thing I regret is leaving you...


It occurred to me, and...

Mikhail's consciousness had vanished cleanly.






◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇






I confronted Mikhail and immediately realized.

Oh, this is no big deal, he thought.

Because Mikhail's attack was too honorable.

It's good that he sticks to the basics, but it's almost like he doesn't have a change of pace. In other words, he only throws strikes, so no matter how powerful they are, they are easy to predict and very easy to deal with.

So, as soon as the game started, Ciel and I switched players, and I took the opportunity to watch from a higher vantage point.

I was impatient when Mikhail used an amazing defensive move in the middle of the fight. No matter how much I could deal with it, the difference in power was obvious. He thought that he would be helpless if he was given a "defensive boundary" that could not be broken by our power.

However, Ciel was more amazing.

No, really.

He was able to see through the weaknesses of Mikael's techniques with scary calmness. As a result, even that defensive technique called "Snow Crystal Shield" was easily eliminated by "Void God".

This is already an overwhelmingly one-sided game.

Mikhail was pathetic and I had scored a complete victory.

The last time I showed the "Oboro Kofuku" and "Senhen Banka" was probably meant as a test for Ciel, but for me, it was my last wish for Mikhail.

Then he overthrew Mikhail, but was asked a funny question at the end.

I honestly don't know what you are, or what you're asking me to be.

Me, me.

It's nothing more than that.

But it's not that I don't have an idea.

Maybe Mikael had noticed Ciel's presence.

So I decided to let the theosophical nuclei talk to each other.

Mikhail seemed to be proud of being a Theosophical Nucleus, so he would be surprised to learn of Ciel's existence, but it was the last time, so there was no problem. With that in mind, he activated his first use of the power, "Soul Ravage," on Mikael.

I was surprised when I tried to do this.

I knew that I wouldn't be able to eat them all up, because Mikhail's existence value was probably ten times greater than mine, but he disappeared in an instant.

And the feeling of fullness you get.

A feeling that I had never felt before no matter what I ate filled my heart.


《With this, I've completed the information on the seven angelic ultimate abilities. I've also acquired Velzar's factor, so I'll begin my 'analysis appraisal'.


Well, not only am I satisfied, but Ciel seems to be happy as well, which is great.

After the battle with Mikhail, I check on Diablo and the others.

I'm glad you're all okay.

"Well, I'm sorry for my mistake this time, and I have no way to apologize..."

"No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What can you do if they stop time?"

'No, I should have thought of more countermeasures. I regret that I was so naive as to think that it would only be of no use to those who could move within the time stoppage, so it would only be fuel efficient and useless. Let us vow not to make such a blunder next time!"

Diablo was unusually depressed, and I had a hard time appeasing him.

I think stopping time is a foul play, but since so few people can handle it, I don't think we need to worry about it that much.

That's what I thought, but Diablo and Souei had a different idea.

Diablo, show me how to handle this.

I've gotten a feel for it, but it's hard to go beyond that. If you know how to do it, please tell me.

"Of course, Lord Souei. And Ultima, too."

They are very motivated and are discussing ways to deal with the problem.

Well, yeah.

If you're not careful, you'll make the same mistakes again and again. If there is an answer, it is better to prepare for it in advance.

I believe that Diablo and his team's efforts will not be in vain, because we can come up with a solution to any problem, if we are given enough time.

That's what I thought, and I stopped myself from interrupting.


It seemed that Leon had not yet regained consciousness, so I ordered Diablo to transport him to the Demon Federation.

I don't think they'll be targeting us anymore, but just in case.

He also ordered Ultima to go to reinforce Sion and the others. Now that Daguerre had begun his march, he judged that Rubellios would be the next battleground.

I'll be right back. I'll be right back, so we'll say goodbye for now.

"Well then, Master Rimuru, I'm off!"

The two of them immediately sprang into action.

Veyron and Zonda followed Ultima, leaving me and Souei alone in the room. However, there was still work to be done.

We're here to investigate the "Holy Void" of Damorgania.

Daguerre didn't seem like someone who would betray him, so something must have happened here. He wanted to know that, and he also thought that he should know what the current situation was in this city.

Come on, Soupy!

Yes!

It is safe to leave it to Souei.

After I finished giving the instructions, I returned to the capital, which was my last concern.

But apparently, there was no need to panic.

You're late. It's over."

And Verglind proudly told me what had happened to me.

Surprisingly, Masayuki had defeated Feldway, the leader of the enemy.

That's great!"

"Wait a minute!　Before you praise me, please listen to me first!"

Well, yeah.

I knew it.

It must have been unwillingness for Masayuki.

But hey, we won, and we should be proud of it.

I'm relieved, too.

Really, I'm just glad everyone's okay.

I felt relieved at the thought, but it was too early to relax, apparently.

Soon after that, we began to receive reports of the war situation in various regions.

It was even more disastrous than I had imagined, and ...... my mind instantly switched to the next battle.

CHAPTER ENDING

It felt a great surge of power, and it opened its eyes, thinly.

What I saw there were little people who were always in my way.

The being standing in front of it was annihilating the swarming people.

It's a power that even Ivalaje, the dragon of destruction, can't ignore, and the killing spree ends in a flash.

The winner - Michael - left without a care in the world for Ivalaje.

A little uncomfortable with this, Ivaräge moved slowly and walked out to the site of the battle.

The end of those who had opposed me for so many years. I unconsciously speak of the many dead bodies floating there.

Fools who attacked with a vulnerability that did not even feel the itch. And yet, they were comforting Ivarajee's ennui.

It was probably because he felt that their deaths were a little too good to be true that he took such a futile action.

But, but...

Such a mere whim brought about an incredible transformation in Ivarajee.

Ivalaje, who had no intelligence, no reason, and was only destructive by instinct, now had a single emotion.

Until now, Ivalaje's only purpose in life has been the urge to destroy.

And yet, in that moment, I thought, "I hate you.

It is the germination of intellect and emotion.

Even God could not have foreseen that the grudge of those who were destroyed by Michael would drive Ivalaje.

Moreover, the transformation does not stop there.

As a result of taking in more than 10,000 "souls," Ivalaje has reached the point of evolution.

No.

I should say that I have welcomed it.

The evil god is reborn as an incarnation of malice.

More cunning, more evil, more intent on the destruction of the world.

Just before it - the evolution into a demon god - began, Ivarajee definitely "saw" it. He saw that the gate leading to the other world had opened just beyond where Michael had left off.

Looking forward to it, Ivalaje falls asleep.

What's beyond that gate?

And what fun things are waiting for you there: .......

He wondered if there was an enemy worthy of this hatred, and Ivalaje's heart almost burst with anticipation.

They were new emotions, desires that I should never have had.

But it's too late.

The day of the awakening of the dreaming evil god is near.






postscript






It's been a while, everyone.

For the first time, I had the deadline extended by a month.

Already, I felt like I was in trouble when I started writing, but it was actually impossible.

As I was rearranging the contents for completion, various developments came to mind. The reason for this is that I couldn't write them out easily, because which one to adopt would have a big impact on the future.

Of course, I had a good amount of other work to do, and one of the reasons was that I couldn't switch my mind off well.

I feel like my brain is not working as well as it used to, and I wonder if it's my age.

When I told such a story to Mr. I in charge of the project, I received warm words of encouragement, "Don't give me that excuse, just get on with writing.

I don't understand.

I've even been told that the schedule for the next volume will never change, so as soon as I finish writing this afterword, I will start on the next volume.

Oops, there's still some revision work to be done before that.

Proofreading is really great. They don't just look for inconsistencies in the current volume, they look for errors in the entire volume.

However, with so many volumes, it seems that small discrepancies can pile up. ......

It would be easier if it was just a typo or a rewrite to make the text easier to understand or something like that.

In my case, I started writing with only a rough plot, so I had to complete most of the checking only in my mind. I was reminded that I would only be able to do that for a short number of books, and that in the future I would try to boil down the plot before I started writing.


So, here we are with the nineteenth volume.

The last war has broken out, and forces are staring each other in the face in many places. I can't write everything in this volume, and will continue in the next volume as a matter of course.

Here's how I'm going to plow through the remaining three books (planned)!

Mikael, who was a candidate for the last boss, has left, and I wonder who will be the last boss. I have a vague idea in my head, but whether or not it will be adopted depends on the future.

It's not uncommon for me to change my direction as I write. I will continue to devote myself to thinking up new stories so that readers can enjoy them more!

I hope you will continue to support "Reincarnation: The Case of the Slime" in the future.

See you in the next volume!
